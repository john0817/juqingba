Every week we tell about a person who was important in the history of the United States. Today, we tell about writer Edith Wharton.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(MUSIC)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPHOEBE ZIMMERMANN: A critic once described American writer Edith Wharton as a &quot;self-made man.&quot; She liked the comment and repeated it. Others said she was a product of New York City. But the New York she wrote about was different from the New York of those who came after her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEdith Wharton was born in New York City in eighteen sixty-two. New York then was several different cities. One New York was made up of people who worked for a living. The other was much smaller. It was made up of families who were so rich they did not need to work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEdith was born into the wealthy New York. But there was a &quot;right&quot; wealthy New York and a &quot;wrong&quot; wealthy New York. Among the rich there were those who had been given money by parents or grandparents. Then there were those who earned their own money, the newly rich.</font><br />\r\n<font face=\"Verdana\" size=\"3\">Edith\'s family was from the &quot;right&quot; New Yorkers, people who had &quot;old&quot; money. It was a group that did not want its way of living changed. It also was a group without many ideas of its own. It was from this group that Edith Wharton created herself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDOUG JOHNSON: Like many girls her age, Edith wrote stories. In one of her childhood stories, a woman apologizes for not having a completely clean house when another woman makes an unexpected visit. Edith\'s mother read the story. Her only comment was that one\'s house was always clean and ready for visitors. Edith\'s house always was.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEdith spent much of her childhood in Europe. She was educated by special teachers and not at schools.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf Edith\'s family feared anything, it was sharp social, cultural, and economic change. Yet these were the things Edith would see in her lifetimeThe end of the Civil War in eighteen sixty-five marked the beginning of great changes in the United States. The country that had been mostly agricultural was becoming industrial. Businessmen and workers increasingly were gaining political and economic power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEdith Wharton saw these changes sooner than most people. And she rejected them. To her, the old America was a victim of the new. She did not like the new values of money replacing the old values of family.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(MUSIC)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPHOEBE ZIMMERMANN: In eighteen eighty-five, she married Edward Wharton. He was her social equal. They lived together for twenty-eight years. But it was a marriage without much love.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn nineteen thirteen, she sought to end the marriage. That she waited so long to do so, one critic said, was a sign of her ties to the idea of family and to tradition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome critics think that Edith Wharton began to write because she found the people of her social group so uninteresting. Others say she began when her husband became sick and she needed something to do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe fact is that Wharton thought of herself as a writer from the time she was a child. Writing gave her a sense of freedom from the restrictions of her social class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDOUG JOHNSON: Writing was just one of a series of things she did. And she did all of them well. She was interested in designing and caring for gardens. She designed her own house. She had an international social life and left a large collection of letters.<br />\r\nIn her lifetime she published about fifty books on a number of subjects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany critics believe Edith Wharton should have written the story of her social group. To do this, however, she would have had to remove herself from the group to see it clearly. She could not do this, even intellectually. Her education and her traditions made it impossible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe subject of Edith Wharton\'s writing became the story of the young and innocent in a dishonest world. She did not make a connection between her work and her own life. What she had was the ability to speak plainly about emotions that, until then, had been hidden.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe also was among the first American women writers to gain a sense of the world as an evil place. &quot;Life is the saddest thing,&quot; she wrote, &quot;next to death.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(MUSIC)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPHOEBE ZIMMERMANN: To show that she could do more than just write stories, she wrote a book with Ogden Codman, &ldquo;The Decoration of Houses.&rdquo; It was very successful. About the same time, her poems and stories also began to be published in Scribner\'s Magazine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn eighteen ninety-nine her collection of stories, &ldquo;The Greater Inclination,&rdquo; appeared. It was an immediate success. When she was in London, she visited a bookstore. The store owner, who did not know who she was, handed her the book. He said to her, &quot;This is what everyone in London is talking about now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDOUG JOHNSON: Three years later her first novel, &ldquo;The Valley of Decision,&rdquo; was published. Three years after that she published her first great popular success, the novel &ldquo;The House of Mirth.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;The House of Mirth&rdquo; is the story of a young woman who lacks the money to continue her high social position. As in so many stories by Edith Wharton, the main character does not control what happens to her. She is a victim who is defeated by forces she does not fight to overcome. This idea is central to much of Edith Wharton\'s best writing. The old families of New York are in conflict with the newly rich families. The major people in the stories are trapped in a hopeless struggle with social forces more powerful than they. And they struggle against people whose beliefs and actions are not as moral as theirs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPHOEBE ZIMMERMANN: This is the situation in one of Wharton\'s most popular books, &ldquo;Ethan Frome,&rdquo; published in nineteen eleven. Unlike her other novels, it is set on a farm in the northeastern state of Massachusetts. It is the story of a man and woman whose lives are controlled, and finally destroyed, by custom. They are the victims of society. They die honorably instead of fighting back. If they were to reject custom, however, they would not be the people they are. And they would not mean as much to each other.<br />\r\nIn her lifetime she published about fifty books on a number of subjects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany critics believe Edith Wharton should have written the story of her social group.

Employees are also returning to work at a third refinery shut down in a separate dispute. However, nine other refineries are still on strike. Here&rsquo;s Hugh Schofield.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt two refineries owned by Esso, one in the north and one in the south, staff have chosen to go back to work. A third refinery in the east, which was shut in a totally separate dispute, is also reopening. Further good news for President Sarkozy is that all of the country&rsquo;s 200 or so fuel supply depots are also now cleared of tickets and operating normally. It means that the threat of the country grinding to a hole for lack of oil has more or less disappeared. <br />\r\nAnti-fraud police in Nigeria have issued a list of more than 100 people who they say should not be allowed to run for political office. The list includes politicians, bankers, civil servants and businessmen. The anti-fraud squad, the EFCC, said those on the list for being prosecuted for alleged corruption and it urged political parties not to endorse them as candidates in next year&rsquo;s elections. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe United Nations has warned Haiti to prepare itself for a potential spread of the cholera outbreak, which has killed more than 250 people. A senior UN official Nigel Fisher said it would be irresponsible to plan for anything other than a considerably wider outbreak. However, he said there were no signs the outbreak was spread. Laura Trevelyan reports.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Haiti has told the BBC his organization is still preparing for the possibility of a national outbreak of cholera. Nigel Fisher said that while the epidemic may be stabilizing in the Artibonite region, it could still spread across the country. And he hoped people weren&rsquo;t being complacent. Cholera experts have expressed surprise that the speed with which Haiti&rsquo;s government moved to say the epidemic was stabilizing, given the possibility that it could take hold in the crowded capital Port-au-Prince. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe youngest inmate of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp has pleaded guilty to killing an American soldier in Afghanistan eight years ago when he was 15 and was still technically a juvenile. The detainee, Omar Khadr, who is a Canadian citizen, was appearing before a military tribunal of the camp. He&rsquo;s also admitted planting roadside bombs. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe US says it remains suspicious of Iran&rsquo;s intentions in making cash payments to the government of Afghanistan. The State Department spokesman P J Crowley said Washington did not question Iran&rsquo;s right to provide financial assistance or Kabul&rsquo;s right to accept it, but he added that Tehran had a tract record of meddling in its neighbour&rsquo;s affairs. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe remain skeptical of Iran&rsquo;s motive, given its history of playing a destabilizing role with its neighbours. We hope that Iran will take responsibility to play a constructive role in the future of Afghanistan. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorld News from the BBC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn official report commissioned in Germany has revealed that members of the foreign ministry were much more actively involved in the Nazi Holocaust than previously thought. The report is due to be published on Thursday. Steve Evans reports.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the authors said the Germany foreign ministry collaborated with the Nazi&rsquo;s violent politics and especially assisted in all aspects of the discrimination, deportation, persecution and genocide of the Jews. The historians discovered the travel expenses of one senior diplomat who went to Serbia in 1941 to help organise the killing of Jews. The expenses form said simply &quot;Liquidation of Jews in Belgrade&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe head of the Italian carmaker Fiat has provoked an angry reaction by saying the company would be better off without Italy. Sergio Marchionne cited Italy&rsquo;s poor record of labour efficiency and industrial competiveness. He said that Fiat&rsquo;s current profits were more than $2billon but none came from Italy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA judge in Italy has ruled the value of life of an Albanian workman who died in an industrial accident is worth ten times less than that of an Italian who might die in a similar incident. Each of the parents of the dead Italian worker was awarded $45,000 in compensation. Here&rsquo;s David Willey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sentence caused some astonishment in legal circles, as the award was based on the earning power of workers in Albania, not in Italy. The judge said the deceased worker&rsquo;s parents will not entitle to unjustified enrichment. If they had been resided in Italy, their receive was some about 10 times greater. If the judge&rsquo;s decision is not overturned by higher court, this will mean that Italian employers will be encouraged to hire workers from poorer countries in preference to those from richer nations. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd that&rsquo;s the BBC News.</p>','http://enedu.putclub.com/update/sest/201010/26/putclub.com_20101026BBC.mp3');

The UN special rapporteur<br />\r\nManfred Novak went further, calling for a full investigation into any torture practices carried out by US military and intelligence officials. Barbara Plett reports. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNavi Pillay said the leak of American field reports added to her concerns that serious breaches of international human rights law occurred in Iraq. She said the documents indicated that the US continued to transfer detainees to Iraqi forces despite knowledge of widespread abuse. But the UN&rsquo;s point man on torture, Manfred Novak, said it wasn&rsquo;t enough to investigate just what happened in Iraq. He urged President Barack Obama to launch a full investigation into any torture practices carried out by US military and intelligence officials, including those who handed detainees to states such as Egypt, Morocco and Syria, knowing they would be ill treated there. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe authorities in Pakistan have allowed journalists to interview a 14-year-old boy being held in detention who said he was trained as a suicide bomber by the Taliban.

Here&rsquo;s James Read.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProsecutors say the attackers arrived at the house party at around mid-night on Friday in several cars and opened fire with automatic weapons. Local media showed bodies strewn across the garden and police found more than 17 bullet casings at the scene. In Ciudad Juares, such killings have become familiar. The city is a battleground between rivaled drugs cartels with about 5,000 murders in the last two years alone. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA stampede among football supporters in Kenya has killed at least seven people as they tried to get into a stadium to watch the match between two of the country&rsquo;s most popular teams. A Red Cross official said six of the fans were killed in Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi and the seventh died in hospital. Will Ross reports.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose who died were crushed as the supporters surged forward to get into the stadium. Dozens of injured were taken to hospitals across the capital. Play was suspended for about 15 minutes and then the match continued. There will no doubt be questions about the organization about the game. It had been raining heavily prior to the match, which made many fans struggle to arrive on time. This could have contributed to the last-minute rush to get in. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere&rsquo;s been more violence in the west African state of Guinea after presidential run-off vote due to be held on Sunday was postponed indefinitely.

She spoke passionately about the time of the need to restore women&rsquo;s rights in the country.

The documents suggest US forces turned a blind eye to torture by Iraqi security forces. The Pentagon said it had no plans to investigate the alleged abuses because its troops passed on reports of such incidents to the Iraqi authorities at the time. Steve Kingstone reports.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a written statement to BBC News, a US military spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan said American policy was consistent with the United Nations convention against torture. He stressed when allegations involved the abuse of Iraqis, by Iraqis, the role of American soldiers was to observe and report what they&rsquo;d seen to their superiors, who would then pass on the evidence to the Iraqi authorities. Colonel Lapan said this was customary international practice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOpposition Social Democrats have secured a majority in the Czech Senate for the first time.

And as we saw, without sound oversight and common-sense protections for consumers, the whole economy is put in jeopardy.&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t serve Main Street.&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t serve Wall Street.&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t serve anyone.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s so important that we not take this country backward &ndash; that we don&rsquo;t go back to the broken system we had before.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got to keep moving forward.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThanks.</p>','http://down02.putclub.com/virtual/backup/update/bush/putclub.com_2010obm1023.mp3');

Every week we tell about a person who was important in the history of the United States. Today, we tell about writer Edith Wharton.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(MUSIC)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPHOEBE ZIMMERMANN: A critic once described American writer Edith Wharton as a &quot;self-made man.&quot; She liked the comment and repeated it. Others said she was a product of New York City. But the New York she wrote about was different from the New York of those who came after her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEdith Wharton was born in New York City in eighteen sixty-two. New York then was several different cities. One New York was made up of people who worked for a living. The other was much smaller. It was made up of families who were so rich they did not need to work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEdith was born into the wealthy New York. But there was a &quot;right&quot; wealthy New York and a &quot;wrong&quot; wealthy New York. Among the rich there were those who had been given money by parents or grandparents. Then there were those who earned their own money, the newly rich.</font><br />\r\n<font face=\"Verdana\" size=\"3\">Edith\'s family was from the &quot;right&quot; New Yorkers, people who had &quot;old&quot; money. It was a group that did not want its way of living changed. It also was a group without many ideas of its own. It was from this group that Edith Wharton created herself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDOUG JOHNSON: Like many girls her age, Edith wrote stories. In one of her childhood stories, a woman apologizes for not having a completely clean house when another woman makes an unexpected visit. Edith\'s mother read the story. Her only comment was that one\'s house was always clean and ready for visitors. Edith\'s house always was.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEdith spent much of her childhood in Europe. She was educated by special teachers and not at schools.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf Edith\'s family feared anything, it was sharp social, cultural, and economic change. Yet these were the things Edith would see in her lifetimeThe end of the Civil War in eighteen sixty-five marked the beginning of great changes in the United States. The country that had been mostly agricultural was becoming industrial. Businessmen and workers increasingly were gaining political and economic power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEdith Wharton saw these changes sooner than most people. And she rejected them. To her, the old America was a victim of the new. She did not like the new values of money replacing the old values of family.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(MUSIC)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPHOEBE ZIMMERMANN: In eighteen eighty-five, she married Edward Wharton. He was her social equal. They lived together for twenty-eight years. But it was a marriage without much love.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn nineteen thirteen, she sought to end the marriage. That she waited so long to do so, one critic said, was a sign of her ties to the idea of family and to tradition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome critics think that Edith Wharton began to write because she found the people of her social group so uninteresting. Others say she began when her husband became sick and she needed something to do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe fact is that Wharton thought of herself as a writer from the time she was a child. Writing gave her a sense of freedom from the restrictions of her social class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDOUG JOHNSON: Writing was just one of a series of things she did. And she did all of them well. She was interested in designing and caring for gardens. She designed her own house. She had an international social life and left a large collection of letters.<br />\r\nIn her lifetime she published about fifty books on a number of subjects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany critics believe Edith Wharton should have written the story of her social group. To do this, however, she would have had to remove herself from the group to see it clearly. She could not do this, even intellectually. Her education and her traditions made it impossible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe subject of Edith Wharton\'s writing became the story of the young and innocent in a dishonest world. She did not make a connection between her work and her own life. What she had was the ability to speak plainly about emotions that, until then, had been hidden.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe also was among the first American women writers to gain a sense of the world as an evil place. &quot;Life is the saddest thing,&quot; she wrote, &quot;next to death.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(MUSIC)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPHOEBE ZIMMERMANN: To show that she could do more than just write stories, she wrote a book with Ogden Codman, &ldquo;The Decoration of Houses.&rdquo; It was very successful. About the same time, her poems and stories also began to be published in Scribner\'s Magazine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn eighteen ninety-nine her collection of stories, &ldquo;The Greater Inclination,&rdquo; appeared. It was an immediate success. When she was in London, she visited a bookstore. The store owner, who did not know who she was, handed her the book. He said to her, &quot;This is what everyone in London is talking about now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDOUG JOHNSON: Three years later her first novel, &ldquo;The Valley of Decision,&rdquo; was published. Three years after that she published her first great popular success, the novel &ldquo;The House of Mirth.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;The House of Mirth&rdquo; is the story of a young woman who lacks the money to continue her high social position. As in so many stories by Edith Wharton, the main character does not control what happens to her. She is a victim who is defeated by forces she does not fight to overcome. This idea is central to much of Edith Wharton\'s best writing. The old families of New York are in conflict with the newly rich families. The major people in the stories are trapped in a hopeless struggle with social forces more powerful than they. And they struggle against people whose beliefs and actions are not as moral as theirs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPHOEBE ZIMMERMANN: This is the situation in one of Wharton\'s most popular books, &ldquo;Ethan Frome,&rdquo; published in nineteen eleven. Unlike her other novels, it is set on a farm in the northeastern state of Massachusetts. It is the story of a man and woman whose lives are controlled, and finally destroyed, by custom. They are the victims of society. They die honorably instead of fighting back. If they were to reject custom, however, they would not be the people they are. And they would not mean as much to each other.<br />\r\nIn her lifetime she published about fifty books on a number of subjects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany critics believe Edith Wharton should have written the story of her social group.

The same is true of today\'s young adults who already have a \n      degree beyond college. As a result, the Census Bureau expects that more \n      women than men will hold professions such as doctors, lawyers and \n      professors.<br>\n      <br>\n      Men had faster growth rates than women in going to graduate school in two \n      thousand nine. Still, women earned sixty percent of the master\'s degrees. \n      That was the level of about ninety percent of all the graduate degrees \n      awarded.<br>\n      <br>\n      But a new report says the two thousand eight-two thousand nine academic \n      year marked a change. Women also earned fifty and four-tenths percent of \n      the doctorate degrees. The Council of Graduate Schools says this was the \n      first year ever that women earned more doctorates than men.<br>\n      <br>\n      Forty-two percent of all doctorates that year -- the largest share -- were \n      in education, engineering, and biological and agricultural sciences. But \n      the report says between nineteen ninety-nine and two thousand nine, \n      graduate enrollment increased in all subjects. The fastest growth was in \n      health sciences, business and engineering.<br>\n      <br>\n      <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172546.jpg\" align=\"right\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\">In \n      two thousand nine, graduate schools reported strong growth of six percent \n      in first-time students from the United States. But enrollment of new \n      international students decreased by about two percent -- the first drop \n      since two thousand four. The share of foreign new students in graduate \n      schools fell from eighteen percent to sixteen and a half percent.<br>\n      <br>\n      In other education news, President Obama marked the new school year with a \n      speech Tuesday. He spoke from a school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<br>\n      <br>\n      BARACK OBAMA: &quot;You know what’s going on in the news, and you also know \n      what’s going on in some of your own families. You\'ve read about the war in \n      Afghanistan. You hear about the recession that we’ve been through. And \n      sometimes maybe you’re seeing the worries in your parents’ faces or sense \n      it in their voice. So a lot of you as a consequence, because we’re going \n      through a tough time as a country, are having to act a lot older than you \n      are.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      President Obama told students they need to work hard in school &quot;because an \n      education has never been more important than it is today.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      BARACK OBAMA: &quot;The farther you go in school, the farther you’re going to \n      go in life. And at a time when other countries are competing with us like \n      never before, when students around the world in Beijing, China, or \n      Bangalore, India, are working harder than ever, and doing better than \n      ever, your success in school is not just going to determine your success, \n      it’s going to determine America’s success in the twenty-first century.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      And that\'s the VOA Special English Education Report, written by Avi \n      Arditti.

I\'m Katherine Cole.<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: And I\'m Bob Doughty. Today, we will tell about head injuries \n      in sports. We will tell about evidence of hearing loss among younger \n      Americans. We will also tell about a study involving more than ten \n      thousand scientists.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      KATHERINE COLE: American researchers are urging athletes to take head \n      injuries seriously. Their comments come after tests showed that a football \n      player suffered serious brain damage from repeated blows to the head. \n      Chris Henry played five years with the Cincinnati Bengals of the National \n      Football League. He died last December when he either fell or jumped from \n      a truck.<br>\n      <br>\n      Researchers reported in June that Chris Henry had a serious kind of brain \n      damage. It is called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C-T-E.<br>\n      <br>\n      Doctors believe that each hit to the head causes a harmful protein to \n      build up in the brain. This causes the inside of neurons to become tangled \n      together, similar to what doctors find in patients with Alzheimer’s \n      disease. Other studies have linked C-T-E to dementia, depression and \n      memory loss. The condition also is sometimes linked to drug and alcohol \n      use.<br>\n      <br>\n      <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172647.jpg\" align=\"right\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\">BOB \n      DOUGHTY: The death of Chris Henry is something of a mystery. He was \n      arguing with his girlfriend before he died. It is unclear whether he fell \n      from the vehicle or jumped on purpose. Tests show that more than fifty \n      former athletes had C-T-E. However, doctors are unable to confirm its \n      presence until after the person dies.<br>\n      <br>\n      In the past, researchers believed that the only cause of C-T-E was a \n      concussion. Chris Henry, for example, never missed a game with the Bengals \n      or in college because of a concussion. This means one of two things. \n      Either he hid the problem from his trainers and coaches. Or less severe \n      hits can lead to C-T-E.<br>\n      <br>\n      Researchers say his death should be a warning to other athletes. \n      Concussions are not like most injuries. They can become life-threatening, \n      but cannot be seen.<br>\n      <br>\n      KATHERINE COLE: America\'s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n      receives reports of about four million sports-related concussions every \n      year. Concussions can result when an athlete is hit in the head. The brain \n      will move around and sometimes strike the skull, or bony inside of the \n      head. This can result in swelling. In extreme cases, it causes bleeding in \n      the brain.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172648.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          A 2007 \n          photo of Chris Henry</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      After suffering a concussion, \n      a player might feel light-headed and pass out. He or she may also have \n      problems with memory and feel sick to the stomach. Researchers are not \n      saying that no one should play contact sports. They just want athletes to \n      know that head injuries are serious. And, repeated head injuries are cause \n      for concern.<br>\n      <br>\n      The best thing to do is seek medical attention. This way doctors can \n      document the injury before it becomes too late.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: American teenagers hear it all the time from their parents. \n      “Are you listening to me? Turn down that music or you will hurt your \n      ears.” A new study has found the parents may be right. The Journal of the \n      American Medical Association published results of the study last month.<br>\n      <br>\n      The study found that many young people in the United States do not hear as \n      well as they used to. One out of five American teenagers has some hearing \n      loss. That is a thirty percent increase in the past fifteen years. One out \n      of twenty teens has a large hearing loss. That is a fifty percent \n      increase.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172649.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Matthew \n          Brady, 17, of Foxborough, Massachusetts has some mild hearing loss \n          from listening to loud music on his earphones</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      KATHERINE COLE: The study \n      used results of hearing tests taken from nineteen eighty-eight through \n      nineteen ninety-four. The researchers compared that information with \n      studies done in two thousand five and two thousand six.<br>\n      <br>\n      They found that boys are more likely to have hearing problems than girls. \n      The researchers say that teenagers from poor families had more hearing \n      loss than those from more wealthy families. The age or race of the teens \n      who were tested had no effect on their chances for hearing loss.<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: The researchers say they are not sure why some teenagers are \n      losing their hearing. Not enough studies have been done and more are \n      needed. Some say the causes may be found in their diet, exposure to \n      poisons, or in their genes. Others believe that listening to loud music on \n      mp3 players with earphones is the major cause.<br>\n      <br>\n      Researchers think that some teenagers do not realize that they are \n      listening to music at very loud levels. To them, loud rock music may seem \n      normal.<br>\n      <br>\n      KATHERINE COLE: Ron Eavey is head of the Department of Otolaryngology at \n      the Vanderbilt Bill Wilkerson Center. He says that parents should stand \n      next to their children while they are wearing earphones. If the parents \n      can hear the music, the sound is too loud. He says that teenagers should \n      set the volume control on their music players to somewhere between \n      one-half and two-thirds the highest level, never louder.<br>\n      <br>\n      Even a small hearing loss can affect a child’s social development. \n      Communication skills and grades in school can also suffer. Doctor Eavey \n      says, “What we’re seeing is a big jump in the prevalence of hearing loss \n      in a very short time, in less than one generation.”<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: Finally, an international study has shown that scientists in \n      Denmark are the happiest with their work. The journal &quot;Nature&quot; published \n      the findings.<br>\n      <br>\n      More than ten thousand five hundred scientists rated their satisfaction \n      with issues like their pay, health care and retirement plan. Sixteen \n      countries provided large enough sample sizes for study organizers to \n      comment on the findings. They said Denmark seems to be the most likely \n      place for a fine research experience. Other countries where scientists \n      seemed happiest were the Netherlands, Sweden, France and Switzerland.<br>\n      <br>\n      KATHERINE COLE: In the study, those questioned rated themselves. One area \n      they judged was the amount of independence they had in their work. They \n      also rated the guidance they received from other workers and more \n      experienced researchers. The scientists said they found those qualities \n      the most important to their happiness.<br>\n      <br>\n      Those who took part in the study work for government or private \n      laboratories, businesses and educational centers. The study showed a big \n      difference between money paid to scientists in private industry as \n      compared with universities. Those in private industry received much more.<br>\n      <br>\n      Scientists in Japan who answered the study expressed the least \n      satisfaction. Only a small percentage said they were very satisfied. Two \n      percent thought their retirement plan was good. Just ten percent thought \n      they had enough independence to do their work.<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: Scientists in India and China also reported low levels of job \n      satisfaction. Still, more of these scientists than those from other \n      countries noted improved work satisfaction during the past year. The \n      journal “Nature” reported that India and China are now spending more money \n      for research. In two thousand seven, China had as many researchers as the \n      European Union or the United States.<br>\n      <br>\n      America’s National Science Foundation noted the number of Chinese studying \n      engineering and natural sciences. It said they complete almost as many \n      doctoral degree programs as students in the United States.<br>\n      <br>\n      KATHERINE COLE: Mohamed H.A. Hassan is president of the African Academy of \n      Sciences in Nairobi, Kenya. He noted fast-increasing wages for scientists \n      in China, India and Brazil. He said countries where wages for scientists \n      are increasing are the same places where job satisfaction is increasing. \n      He said one simple message of the study is, pay them and they will stay.<br>\n      <br>\n      Mister Hassan noted that scientists are not wealthy. But he said they are \n      well-paid in places where science is important.<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: An American psychological expert commented on study results \n      involving women. The study found that, six to ten years after receiving \n      doctoral degrees, women scientists are paid less than men. And, this \n      difference in pay widens over time.<br>\n      <br>\n      Kathleen Christensen directs the Workplace, Work Force and Working \n      Families program at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in New York. She \n      questioned why women stay in lower positions although they have skills to \n      deal with more responsibility. She also questioned whether women are \n      getting better jobs, but earning less for the same level of work as men. \n      She said there is proof for both possibilities.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      KATHERINE COLE: This SCIENCE IN THE NEWS was written by Mike DeFabo, Jim \n      Tedder and Jerilyn Watson.

And in the second \n      decade, he returned to national politics to bring, once more, dramatic \n      changes to the United States.<br>\n      <br>\n      Theodore Roosevelt was a distant cousin of Franklin Roosevelt, a Democrat \n      who became president in nineteen thirty-three.<br>\n      <br>\n      In nineteen twelve, Teddy Roosevelt organized a new political party: the \n      Progressives. Roosevelt created this new party after he failed to win the \n      Republican presidential nomination.<br>\n      <br>\n      The Republican convention of nineteen twelve had been controlled by \n      conservative supporters of President William Howard Taft. And, as we hear \n      now from Leo Scully and Maurice Joyce, the party nominated Taft for four \n      more years in the White House.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172437.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"113\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Theodore \n          Roosevelt at what appears to be the first Progressive Party \n          Convention.

And he and his supporters held their \n      own convention. They formed the Progressive party and approved a platform \n      that promised reforms. These reforms were proposed to make the government \n      serve the people and carry out more fully their desire for social \n      progress.<br>\n      <br>\n      The Democratic Party also nominated a candidate who supported progressive \n      ideas. The Democrats chose Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey, a former \n      president of Princeton University.<br>\n      <br>\n      So, for the first time in many years, there were three major candidates \n      for president. Wilson clearly had the best chance to win. He had the \n      support of almost all the Democrats. The Republicans, however, were split. \n      Some supported Taft. The others were for Roosevelt.<br>\n      <br>\n      MAURICE JOYCE: Roosevelt refused to accept the idea of defeat. He \n      campaigned hard, visiting many cities and towns, making speech after \n      speech. Wilson also campaigned hard. He seemed to enjoy it as much as \n      Roosevelt.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172438.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Theodore \n          Roosevelt</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      Taft did not like it at all. \n      He refused to do much campaigning. He spent most of the time at his summer \n      home.<br>\n      <br>\n      It was a quiet election campaign...until the middle of October. Then, only \n      three weeks before election day, Roosevelt was shot.<br>\n      <br>\n      LEO SCULLY: It happened in Milwaukee. Roosevelt had just left his hotel \n      and climbed into the automobile that would carry him to the hall where he \n      planned to make a speech. As he stood in the open car, an extremist named \n      John Schrank ran up to him, pulled a gun from his coat, and fired a bullet \n      into Roosevelt\'s chest.<br>\n      <br>\n      The bullet knocked him down. Roosevelt said it felt as if he had been \n      kicked by a mule. He jumped up and put his hand to the wound. The bullet \n      had passed through the inside pocket of his coat. It struck a steel case \n      that held his glasses, and went through the folded fifty pages of his \n      written speech. These slowed the bullet, and it went only a few \n      centimeters into his chest.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172439.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          An x-ray \n          of Theodore Roosevelt\'s rib showing the bullet shot by John Schrank</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      MAURICE JOYCE: Roosevelt did \n      not know if he was seriously wounded. He put his hand to his mouth and \n      coughed. No blood came. And he knew the shot had not damaged his lungs. \n      Roosevelt ordered the crowd around to stop beating Schrank. &quot;Bring him to \n      me,&quot; he said. He looked down at the man. &quot;You poor creature,&quot; said \n      Roosevelt. Then he turned away.<br>\n      <br>\n      Doctors arrived. They said Roosevelt must go at once to the hospital. But \n      Roosevelt refused. He said he would go to the hall. &quot;I will make this \n      speech,&quot; he said, &quot;or die. It will be one or the other.&quot; On his way to the \n      hall, he told a friend: &quot;It takes more than that to kill a Roosevelt. I do \n      not care a rap about being shot. Not a rap.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      LEO SCULLY: At the hall, he stood before the big crowd. His face was \n      white. But he stood straight, without help. Someone announced that \n      Roosevelt had been wounded, but still planned to speak.<br>\n      <br>\n      Roosevelt\'s voice was very low, almost a whisper. &quot;I am going to ask you \n      to be very quiet. And please excuse me from making a long speech. I will \n      do the best I can. But there is a bullet in me.&quot; He paused and then \n      continued. &quot;It is nothing. I am not hurt badly. I have something to say. \n      And I will say it as long as there is life in my body.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      MAURICE JOYCE: Roosevelt\'s speech was not important. He said nothing that \n      he had not already said many times before. What was important, however, \n      was his cool courage. Men did not see his act as foolish or \n      overly-dramatic. They saw it as the brave act of a strong man. To the \n      public, he was a hero.<br>\n      <br>\n      Roosevelt spoke for almost an hour. Finally, very weak, he let himself be \n      helped from the hall. He was rushed to a hospital where doctors could \n      examine the wound.<br>\n      <br>\n      LEO SCULLY: The doctors found that the bullet had broken a rib, but caused \n      no serious damage. They decided to leave the bullet where it was. The next \n      day, Roosevelt made a statement from his hospital bed. &quot;Tell the people \n      not to worry about me. For if I go down, another will take my place.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      President Taft and Woodrow Wilson sent messages of regret to Roosevelt. \n      They announced that they would not campaign until Roosevelt was able to do \n      so.<br>\n      <br>\n      MAURICE JOYCE: Roosevelt\'s condition improved quickly. After two weeks of \n      rest, he was ready to continue his campaign for the presidency. He made a \n      speech to a big crowd at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Everyone \n      was surprised to see how strong and healthy he seemed.<br>\n      <br>\n      Wilson ended his campaign in New York City the next day. He told a \n      cheering crowd of Democrats: &quot;What the Democratic Party proposes to do is \n      to go into power and do the things that the Republican Party has been \n      talking about for sixteen years.&quot;<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172440.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Woodrow \n          Wilson</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      LEO SCULLY: On November \n      fifth, the people voted. The winner was Woodrow Wilson. He received more \n      than six million votes. Roosevelt was second with four million. Taft \n      received only about three and a half million. Wilson\'s victory was even \n      greater in the electoral vote. He got four hundred thirty-five. Roosevelt \n      got only eighty-eight. And Taft received only the eight electoral votes of \n      Utah and Vermont.<br>\n      <br>\n      The Democrats won not only the White House, but also control of Congress. \n      And a number of Democratic governors were elected in states formerly \n      controlled by Republicans.<br>\n      <br>\n      MAURICE JOYCE: The nineteen twelve campaign ended public life for Theodore \n      Roosevelt. Soon after the election, a friend visited Roosevelt and talked \n      of possible victory in nineteen sixteen.<br>\n      <br>\n      &quot;I thought you were a better politician,&quot; Roosevelt said. &quot;The fight is \n      over. We are beaten. There is only one thing to do. That is to go back to \n      the Republican Party. You cannot hold a party like the Progressive Party \n      together. There are no loaves and fishes...no financial support.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      LEO SCULLY: War was soon to break out in Europe. The United States would \n      enter the struggle in nineteen seventeen.<br>\n      <br>\n      As always, Roosevelt was ready to join in a fight. He asked for permission \n      to organize an American force and lead it into battle in France. President \n      Wilson, however, turned down the request. Roosevelt was sure that it was a \n      political decision. He never forgave Wilson for keeping him out of the \n      war.<br>\n      <br>\n      Although Roosevelt himself could not fight, four of his sons went into \n      battle. One -- his youngest son Quentin -- did not return. When he \n      received news of his son\'s death, Roosevelt wrote these words to honor \n      him:<br>\n      <br>\n      MAURICE JOYCE: &quot;Only those are fit to live who do not fear to die. And \n      none are fit to die who have shrunk from the joy of life. Both life and \n      death are parts of the same great adventure. All of us who give service \n      and stand ready for sacrifice are torch bearers. We run with the torches \n      until we fall, satisfied if we can then pass them to the hands of other \n      runners.<br>\n      <br>\n      &quot;The torches whose flame is brightest are carried by the brave men on the \n      battlefield and by the brave women whose husbands, lovers, sons, and \n      brothers struggle there. These are the torch bearers. These are they who \n      have dared the great adventure.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      LEO SCULLY: Roosevelt\'s own great adventure was itself coming to an end.<br>\n      <br>\n      He suffered from painful attacks of inflammatory rheumatism and from a \n      serious ear infection.

Many banks did not have enough money in reserve to \n      protect against their losses. Now there is a proposed solution.<br>\n      <br>\n      On Sunday, banking supervisors from twenty-six nations and Hong Kong met \n      in Basel, Switzerland. They announced proposals to make banks safer by \n      requiring them to increase their reserves.<br>\n      <br>\n      The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has been working on a set of \n      recommendations known as Basel Three. These are based on agreements \n      reached in July by officials from a group of leading industrial nations.<br>\n      <br>\n      The goal is to stop the cycle of easing rules on banks in good times and \n      tightening them only after a crisis.<br>\n      <br>\n      Under the new rules, banks would have to hold reserves equal to seven \n      percent of their risk-weighted assets. Mainly this means loans. Currently \n      banks are required to hold two percent in reserve.<br>\n      <br>\n      The bigger reserves could be in the form of cash or common stock, also \n      known as common equity. Banks would also have to hold extra reserves as \n      their national economies improve.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172231.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"113\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          The \n          Federal Reserve in Washington is the United States\' central bank. \n          International bank supervisors want banks to increase their capital \n          reserves for a rainy day</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      The new requirements would go \n      into effect starting in January of two thousand thirteen. Banks would have \n      five years to fully meet them. International banking lawyer Ernie Patrikis, \n      a former vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, explains \n      why.<br>\n      <br>\n      ERNIE PATRIKIS: &quot;We cannot be telling banks, on the one hand, raise \n      capital right away, and on the other hand lend more.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      Economic growth remains slow in much of the developed world. The worry is \n      that any decrease in lending could hurt a global recovery.<br>\n      <br>\n      One way for banks to meet the proposed new rules would be to sell more of \n      their stock. That is what Germany’s Deutsche Bank did last week. It \n      announced a sale offer valued at over eleven billion dollars.<br>\n      <br>\n      Ernie Patrikis thinks chief executive officers of banks have three \n      choices.<br>\n      <br>\n      ERNIE PATRIKIS: &quot;One is to go out and raise more common equity. Another \n      one is to not pay dividends. And that’s not something most CEO’s want to \n      do because their shareholders aren’t going to be particularly happy. And \n      the third choice is sell assets -- downsize the bank.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      Nations on the Basel committee will now seek to pass the new rules into \n      law so their banking supervisors can enforce them.<br>\n      <br>\n      Banks that fall below the reserve limits could have to stop paying \n      dividends to shareholders or bonuses to top employees. Ending dividends \n      would anger shareholders. And limiting pay could send bankers fleeing to \n      hedge funds, where there are fewer rules.<br>\n      <br>\n      And that’s the VOA Special English Economics Report, written by Mario \n      Ritter.

She studies \n      the remains of humans to learn about different ancient cultures in China. \n      She says studying ancient bones can tell about a population’s background, \n      movement, and even about marriages between different groups. For example, \n      a tooth can tell about an individual’s diet and social level. Comparing \n      teeth across an area can show genetic links between populations.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: Paleontologist Bolortsetseg Minjin studies the ancient \n      remains of dinosaurs in her native Mongolia.

Ken Banks was working on a project in Africa. He saw a \n      need for a kind of technology that would permit people in rural areas to \n      communicate to groups without the use of the Internet. He knew that many \n      organizations in rural areas did not have an Internet connection. He knew \n      they needed a communication method that was easy and low cost. So, he \n      developed a computer program that permits people to send information to \n      groups using text messages on wireless telephones. He made his \n      FrontlineSMS program free so that anyone can use it.<br>\n      <br>\n      KEN BANKS: “We are always trying to lower the barrier to entry for \n      nonprofits.

Mr. Lin says he can then investigate the \n      computer images of an archeological area without actually being at the \n      physical place.

But \n      both pay careful attention to how human relationships are linked to the \n      environment. Jerry Glover studies agriculture, the environment and food \n      security. He says in the past, humans lived from crops that were \n      perennials. These kinds of plants stay alive throughout the year. They \n      make effective use of water and nutrients. As populations grew, humans \n      started planting crops every year that require fertilizers, insecticides \n      and water. He says these annuals also require more time, effort and money \n      to grow.<br>\n      <br>\n      Jerry Glover says it is time to put natural plant communities back in \n      control of our land. Through his work at the Land Institute in Kansas, he \n      is working with plant experts and scientists to develop perennial crops. \n      These crops would revolutionize agriculture by increasing food production \n      while also supporting a healthier environment.<br>\n      <br>\n      BARBARA KLEIN: Saleem Ali is an expert on environmental conflicts and how \n      to solve them. He acts as a negotiator for governments, companies and \n      native communities when dealing with environmental problems. He says that \n      working together to save the environment can sometimes bring conflicting \n      sides together around the shared goal of protecting resources.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: Our last two National Geographic explorers are activists in \n      Africa. Kakenya Ntaiya grew up in an extremely poor family in Kenya. Like \n      other girls in her village, she was expected to end her schooling and \n      marry at the age of thirteen. But she decided this future was not for her. \n      She worked hard to continue her studies and is completing her doctorate \n      degree in the United States.

A planetarium is a theater with a rounded ceiling onto which \n      images of the stars and planets are projected. Planetariums give \n      educational shows about astronomy and what you can see in the night sky. \n      Today, we tell about the past, present, and future of planetariums. And, \n      we visit the Albert Einstein Planetarium at the Smithsonian National Air \n      and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: Since ancient times, humans have worked on ways to understand \n      and represent the movement of the stars and planets. Experts credit the \n      Greek astronomer Archimedes with developing the earliest known device to \n      show the daily movement of the planets. He lived more than two thousand \n      years ago. These mechanical devices that show the relative placement and \n      movement of the planets and moons are sometimes called orreries. Over the \n      centuries, scientific thinkers worked to develop these devices and improve \n      their accuracy and complexity.<br>\n      <br>\n      The words “orrery” and “planetarium” were once used interchangeably. \n      Today, the world “planetarium” generally means a theater inside a dome.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172232.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"120\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          The \n          original Carl Zeiss projector at the Smithsonian\'s Albert Einstein \n          Planetarium projects an image from the show &quot;Infinity Express: A \n          20-Minute Tour of the Universe&quot;</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      BARBARA KLEIN: The earliest \n      planetarium that is still working today is in the Netherlands, although \n      the device is actually an orrery. It was built by a man named Eise Eisinga \n      starting in seventeen seventy-four. It took him seven years to build this \n      moving device inside a room in his house. All the planets move at the same \n      speed as the real planets in our solar system. So, it takes one year for \n      Earth to move around the sun and about twenty-nine years for Saturn to do \n      so. Eisinga made his device out of wood, metal nails, a clock and nine \n      weights.<br>\n      <br>\n      Other versions of early planetariums were large globes. People could sit \n      inside them. Holes were cut into the walls of these globes to represent \n      stars.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: A group of German engineers and scientists helped develop the \n      modern planetarium between nineteen ten and nineteen thirty. The creators \n      of the Deutsches Museum of science and technology in Munich wanted to \n      build a planetarium. So, they asked the Carl Zeiss company in Germany to \n      help with this plan. This company was known for making scientific \n      equipment such as microscopes.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172233.jpg\" width=\"120\" height=\"171\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          The \n          oldest working planetarium was built by Eise Eisinga in the Dutch town \n          of Frankston</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      It took engineers at Zeiss \n      several years to invent a new planetarium technology. The complex \n      mechanical device they made projected light through “star plates” of film \n      that contained images of thousands of stars. Public viewings of the first \n      Zeiss planetarium projector began in nineteen twenty-three.<br>\n      <br>\n      BARBARA KLEIN: Soon, other cities in Europe and later in the United States \n      began ordering planetarium devices from Zeiss. An American business leader \n      named Max Adler learned about these planetariums and traveled to Germany \n      to see one for himself.<br>\n      <br>\n      He was so amazed with the Zeiss device that he donated the money for a \n      planetarium to be built in his native Chicago, Illinois.<br>\n      <br>\n      The Adler Planetarium was the first modern planetarium in the United \n      States. It opened its doors to the public in nineteen thirty. Planetariums \n      soon opened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Los Angeles, California and New \n      York City.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: Planetarium technology continues to evolve and improve to \n      this day. But what if you live far away from a city with a planetarium?<br>\n      <br>\n      Dan Neafus helps supervise the Gates Planetarium at the Denver Museum of \n      Nature and Science in Colorado. He says new technologies are helping to \n      connect planetariums with viewers in other areas. There are relatively few \n      digital planetariums around the world. But this technology could bring \n      space education and the experience of a planetarium show to more people \n      through the use of a computer and Internet connection.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172234.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          \n          Planetarium in Chicago was the first modern planetarium in the United \n          States</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      BARBARA KLEIN: The Loch Ness \n      Production company in Colorado makes shows, images and music for the \n      planetarium community. The company also gathers facts about planetariums \n      around the world. It says there are over one thousand five hundred \n      planetariums in the United States. Many kinds of organizations have \n      planetariums. They include museums, science centers, universities, schools \n      and even astronomy clubs. Some planetariums have domes that measure over \n      twenty meters, while others are much smaller.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: Some planetariums use film projections. More technologically \n      advanced planetariums use digital systems controlled by computers. Digital \n      technologies offer planetariums many choices. These theaters can show \n      movies about space. Or, these planetariums can serve as classrooms where \n      live interactive presentations take place. For example, astronomers can \n      guide viewers on a trip around the universe using image databases with \n      real information about the placement of stars and planets.<br>\n      <br>\n      BARBARA KLEIN: The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in \n      Washington, D.C. has both a digital system and a projector system made by \n      the Carl Zeiss company.<br>\n      <br>\n      This Zeiss Model VI was a gift to the museum from West Germany in honor of \n      the United States’ two hundred year anniversary. Last week, we attended a \n      live show called “The Stars Tonight.” Astronomer Bill Dedmond showed \n      visitors the night sky as the season changes from summer to fall.<br>\n      <br>\n      BILL DEDMOND: “See, that’s how night sky is supposed to look. You can see \n      thousands of stars when you are away from the city light pollution. You \n      can even see this bright band of light here all the way across the sky. \n      What is that bright band of light?”<br>\n      <br>\n      KIDS: “The Milky Way!”<br>\n      <br>\n      BILL DEDMOND: “OK, Excellent!”<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: Bill Dedmond talked about the groups of stars or \n      constellations in the night sky. He pointed out an important \n      constellation, the Big Dipper. If you can find this group of stars, you \n      can easily find the North Star, or Polaris. Mr. Dedmond also gave viewers \n      a tour of the planets.<br>\n      <br>\n      BILL DEDMOND: “Our galaxy contains a couple hundred billion stars and we \n      know there are about one hundred twenty-five billion other galaxies. Just \n      incredible how many stars there are.”<br>\n      <br>\n      BARBARA KLEIN: Speaking of stars, one of the Air and Space Museum’s \n      planetarium shows is called “Journey to the Stars.” The movie is presented \n      by actress Whoopi Goldberg. It tells about the life of a star using our \n      sun as an example.<br>\n      <br>\n      WHOOPI GOLDBERG: “The first stars changed everything, combining hydrogen \n      and helium into new elements such as oxygen and carbon. Then supernovas \n      blasted these elements into space, supplying ingredients for stars and \n      planets to come. And though it may sound incredible, your body actually \n      contains about a teaspoon’s worth of this stuff formed thirteen billion \n      years ago by the very first stars.”<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: The movie describes the many stages in the life of a star. \n      Some stars known as super giants are about a thousand times bigger than \n      our sun.<br>\n      <br>\n      The movie “Journey to the Stars” is very helpful not only because it tells \n      interesting facts about stars and space. The movie helps viewers get a \n      better idea of the extraordinary size and volume of space and the huge \n      number of stars within it. This sense of size is hard to understand by \n      just reading a book. The planetarium makes it feel as if you are \n      observing, moving through and exploring space.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172235.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          A scene \n          from the Smithsonian\'s planetarium show &quot;Black Holes: The Other Side \n          of Infinity&quot;</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      BARBARA KLEIN: Another show \n      at the Smithsonian’s planetarium is called “Black Holes: The Other Side of \n      Infinity.” Black Holes are not actually holes. They are extremely massive \n      concentrations of matter. The actor Liam Neeson narrates the movie.<br>\n      <br>\n      LIAM NEESON: “How do you find something that hides in the dark? You have \n      to look for its tell-tale signs. Swift’s instruments are designed to \n      record bursts of high energy radiation. Gamma rays don’t penetrate Earth’s \n      atmosphere, but out here in space, Swift’s view of them is front row \n      center. They erupt when a black hole is born. That happens when a large \n      star dies in a blaze of glory called a super nova.”<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: It takes a lot of work to produce a good planetarium movie. \n      Experts at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science made the “Black Holes” \n      movie. They worked with movie producers, computer experts, astronomers, \n      astrophysicists and other professionals. Their film is scientifically \n      correct and also a lot of fun to watch. Many images in the movie are based \n      on complex mathematical calculations about space gathered by scientists.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      BARBARA KLEIN: Next week, the ‘Imiloa Astronomy Center in Hawaii will host \n      a six-day ‘Imiloa Fulldome Film Festival. Museum and planetarium \n      professionals from around the world will be able to watch some of the \n      latest movies available for digital planetarium theaters.<br>\n      <br>\n      The ‘Imiloa Astronomy Center is part of the University of Hawaii at Hilo. \n      The center’s planetarium has the world’s first three-dimensional \n      planetarium system. Viewers wear special glasses to experience this \n      effect. The Astronomy Center is an example of how technologies will \n      continue to change and improve experiencing the night sky in planetariums \n      of the future.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: This program was written and produced by Dana Demange.

Faith Lapidus takes us there.<br>\n      <br>\n      FAITH LAPIDUS: You could drive right by the Robert Frost Farm if you were \n      not looking for it. It is a simple, white wooden farm house. It is not \n      unlike other farmhouses of the same age in the area.<br>\n      <br>\n      The grounds are still green and flowery at this end of the summer visit. \n      Birds sing loudly; insects buzz. There is a cleared field but trees are \n      what you mostly see. Some of them are the birches Frost wrote about. Here \n      he reads part of the poem, “Birches.”<br>\n      <br>\n      ROBERT FROST:<br>\n      <br>\n      When I see birches bend to left and right<br>\n      <br>\n      Across the lines of straighter darker trees,<br>\n      <br>\n      I like to think some boy\'s been swinging them.<br>\n      <br>\n      But swinging doesn\'t bend them down to stay<br>\n      <br>\n      As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them<br>\n      <br>\n      Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br>\n      <br>\n      After a rain. They click upon themselves<br>\n      <br>\n      As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored<br>\n      <br>\n      As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br>\n      <br>\n      Soon the sun\'s warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br>\n      <br>\n      Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust--<br>\n      <br>\n      Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br>\n      <br>\n      You\'d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.<br>\n      <br>\n      Robert Frost lived at the Derry farm from nineteen hundred to nineteen \n      eleven. His wife Elinor had persuaded Frost’s grandfather to buy the farm \n      for them. She had hoped a new start in farming would help her husband deal \n      with the tragic loss of their four-year-old son to the disease cholera.<br>\n      <br>\n      Randee Rae Martin is a guide at the Robert Frost Farm. She says Frost \n      decided he would raise chickens. He also owned one cow. She said he \n      enjoyed the attempt at farming but was not good at it. The farm was a good \n      place for him to write and find sources for poems, however. The cow was \n      one of them.<br>\n      <br>\n      “The Cow in Apple Time” is a poem about how the cow decided she liked \n      apples instead of grass. Eating apples caused an effect like people \n      drinking alcohol. The poet says the cow stopped producing milk as a \n      result. A young visitor to the farm reads the end of the poem:<br>\n      <br>\n      YOUNG VISITOR:<br>\n      <br>\n      She runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten.<br>\n      <br>\n      The windfalls spiked with stubble and worm-eaten.<br>\n      <br>\n      She leaves them bitten when she has to fly.<br>\n      <br>\n      She bellows on a knoll against the sky.<br>\n      <br>\n      Her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry.<br>\n      <br>\n      Bill Gleed is park manager of the Robert Frost Farm. He explains that “The \n      Cow in Apple Time” is an example of Robert Frost’s poetic fooling. He says \n      Frost’s cow did go dry, but not because of eating apples. He said Frost \n      kept poet’s hours instead of farmer’s hours. He did not get up early to \n      milk the cow. He did not milk her until the middle of the day. And that is \n      really why her milk went dry.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021171924.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          The \n          kitchen where Robert Frost wrote “Storm Fear” and “Tree at My Window</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      The tour of the farmhouse \n      provides a sense of how the Frosts lived with no electricity or running \n      water.

She worked to reproduce her childhood \n      home as closely as possible. Many of the books and other objects in the \n      living room belonged to the family.<br>\n      <br>\n      Robert Frost lived most of his life in Massachusetts. But he said several \n      times the place where he was happiest was the farm in Derry.

She stands on a small \n      island in New York harbor, near the great city. In her right hand, she \n      holds a torch with a golden flame high above her head.

Its official name was “Liberty Enlightening the World.” Frederic \n      Auguste Bartholdi built the statue in several parts. These were shipped to \n      New York and then put together on a base, or pedestal. The statue was \n      dedicated in a ceremony on October twenty-eighth, eighteen eighty-six.<br>\n      <br>\n      The statue itself stands about forty-six meters tall. The distance from \n      the ground to the top of the golden torch is about ninety-three meters. \n      The statue can be seen from far away. For the many millions of immigrants \n      who came to America on ships, the Statue of Liberty was the first thing \n      they saw.<br>\n      <br>\n      In eighteen eighty-three, American poet Emma Lazarus wrote a poem as if \n      Lady Liberty were speaking. In part it says: “Give me your tired, your \n      poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free … I lift my lamp beside \n      the golden door.”<br>\n      <br>\n      Today, more than three million people visit the Statue of Liberty each \n      year. Most come by a ferryboat from New York. Some visitors go inside the \n      statue and climb as high as the crown to look down on the harbor.

State media later announced the appointment of Kim \n      Jong Un to the Workers\' Party Central Committee.<br>\n      <br>\n      He was also named to the powerful Central Military Commission. There, he \n      joins Jang Song Taek, who is considered second in power after Kim Jong Il. \n      Jang Song Taek is married to Kim Kyong Hui, the leader\'s sister.<br>\n      <br>\n      North Korea specialist Andrei Lankov says Kim Jong Il seems to want the \n      couple to help prepare his young son for leadership. Then, in case of Kim \n      Jong Il\'s sudden death, he says, they will become &quot;sort of prince-regent \n      and princess-regent.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      ANDREI LANKOV: &quot;That is, people who will be running the country and will \n      be making actual decisions.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      Yet some North Korea experts say Jang Song Taek was not always so trusted. \n      In two thousand four, he disappeared from public for a year-and-a-half.<br>\n      <br>\n      Much of what experts know or think they know about North Korea comes from \n      North Koreans who fled the country.<br>\n      <br>\n      Some experts think this week\'s political appointments could create \n      tensions with North Korea\'s aging generals. One theory is that the \n      military could object if the ruling party looks for friendship with South \n      Korea to help save North Korea’s economy.<br>\n      <br>\n      Another theory is that Kim Jong Un might try to build power by dismissing \n      opponents and inciting South Korea.<br>\n      <br>\n      But on Thursday military officials from the two Koreas held their first \n      talks in two years.

He was Woodrow Wilson -- the twenty-eighth president of the \n      United States.<br>\n      <br>\n      Wilson belonged to the Democratic Party. He was progressive in his belief \n      that government should take an active part in efforts for social reforms.<br>\n      <br>\n      This week in our series, Kay Gallant and Harry Monroe begin the story of \n      Wilson\'s presidency.<br>\n      <br>\n      KAY GALANT: Woodrow Wilson had spent most of his life at Princeton \n      University. First he was a professor. Then he was university president. \n      Next, Wilson was elected governor of the state of New Jersey. His early \n      success as governor made him a leading candidate for the Democratic \n      presidential nomination in nineteen twelve.<br>\n      <br>\n      Wilson traveled widely around the country during the campaign. He made \n      speeches to many groups. He tried to make himself and his ideas known to \n      as many Americans as possible.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172027.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"113\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Woodrow \n          Wilson and his cabinet seated around table, 1913</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      HARRY MONROE: Wilson called \n      his program &quot;the New Freedom.&quot; One of his campaign promises was to fight \n      for better conditions for America\'s small business owners.<br>\n      <br>\n      Such proposals helped him win the Democratic nomination for president. \n      Then he defeated President William Howard Taft and former president \n      Theodore Roosevelt in the election. Woodrow Wilson, the former president \n      of a university, had become the president of a nation.<br>\n      <br>\n      The largest crowd in Washington, D.C.\'s history welcomed Wilson outside \n      the Capitol Building on the day of his inauguration. He called on the \n      American people to join him in making the country a better place. &quot;Our \n      duty,&quot; Wilson said, &quot;is to correct the evil without hurting the good. I \n      call all honest men, all patriotic, all forward-looking men to my side.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      KAY GALANT: Wilson wasted no time. He immediately called a special session \n      of Congress to act on Democratic campaign promises to reduce import taxes, \n      or tariffs. Wilson felt strongly about the need to reform these taxes. He \n      broke tradition by leaving the White House to appear before Congress, in \n      person, to appeal for his tariff proposals.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172028.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          A crowd \n          gathering for the Woodrow Wilson\'s inauguration parade in 1913</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      Many members of Congress \n      opposed Wilson\'s plans. But the new president used the results of a Senate \n      investigation to win the fight. The investigation showed that a number of \n      senators owned companies that depended on high tariffs for their profits. \n      The votes of these senators were influenced by their property holdings.<br>\n      <br>\n      Public knowledge of the situation forced many of them to give up their \n      holdings and stop resisting tariff reform. Congress finally approved \n      Wilson\'s proposals.<br>\n      <br>\n      HARRY MONROE: Lower tariffs reduced the amount of money taken in by the \n      federal government. So the Senate also approved a tax on income, or \n      earnings. A constitutional amendment had been passed earlier to permit \n      such a tax.<br>\n      <br>\n      President Wilson and the Democratic Party were pleased with the new tariff \n      and income tax bills. But they were far from finished. Next they turned \n      their efforts to reform of the banking industry.<br>\n      <br>\n      For several years, many people had recognized the need for changes in the \n      banking system. The old system of uncontrolled private banks had developed \n      years earlier, before the United States became a major industrial nation. \n      Many people agreed that a more modern system was needed. But they could \n      not agree on details.<br>\n      <br>\n      KAY GALANT: President Wilson said control of the nation\'s wealth was held \n      by too few men. He noted a report that said just two men controlled ten \n      percent of the total wealth of the United States.<br>\n      <br>\n      Wilson said the nation needed a money supply that could be increased or \n      reduced, when necessary, to correct economic conditions. He said a method \n      was needed to let banks help each other during economic emergencies. And \n      he said laws were needed to prevent a few wealthy men from using the \n      economic resources of the country for their own purposes.<br>\n      <br>\n      Finally, Wilson said, &quot;The control of this system of banking must be \n      public, not private. It must belong to the government itself.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      HARRY MONROE: Wilson called his proposal for a central bank the Federal \n      Reserve System.<br>\n      <br>\n      Under the plan, the nation would be divided into twelve areas. Each area \n      would have its own federal reserve bank. These area banks would not do \n      business with the public. They would serve only as &quot;bankers\' banks.&quot; And \n      they would issue a new form of money supported by the federal government. \n      Most important, the leaders of the new system would be chosen by the \n      government--not by private business.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021172029.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Woodrow \n          Wilson</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      KAY GALANT: Bankers, business \n      leaders, and their representatives in Congress sharply criticized \n      President Wilson\'s proposals. They said government control of the banking \n      system was socialism, not capitalism.<br>\n      <br>\n      But Wilson refused to change his proposals. And he helped to lead the \n      fight to make them law. Finally, Congress agreed.<br>\n      <br>\n      It did not take long for bankers to discover that the new system was much \n      better than the old one. Today, the Federal Reserve System is one of the \n      most important institutions in the United States.<br>\n      <br>\n      HARRY MONROE: For Woodrow Wilson, the fight over the banking system was \n      yet another political success. He had won major reforms in the nation\'s \n      tariffs, taxes, and banking systems. Now he told Congress that new \n      legislation was needed to control the power of monopolies and trusts. \n      These were the giant companies and business alliances that controlled \n      complete industries.<br>\n      <br>\n      Wilson proposed a new anti-trust law to control the actions of large \n      companies. His supporters in Congress wrote a bill that listed a number of \n      business activities that no longer would be permitted.<br>\n      <br>\n      For example, no longer could a company set prices that would reduce \n      competition or create a monopoly. No longer could corporations buy stocks \n      of competing companies. No longer could they demand that a store refuse to \n      sell competing products. The new bill also protected labor unions from \n      being charged with anti-trust violations. It gave unions more power to \n      organize and protect workers.<br>\n      <br>\n      KAY GALANT: At President Wilson\'s request, Congress also prepared a law \n      that set up a government agency called the Federal Trade Commission. The \n      commission was given the job of investigating wrong-doing in business. It \n      had the power to force companies to obey the new anti-trust laws and other \n      rules.<br>\n      <br>\n      Both the anti-trust law and the Federal Trade Commission helped protect \n      small business owners from the power of business giants. Once again, the \n      proposals caused fierce debate. But, once again, Congress finally voted to \n      give Wilson most of what he wanted.<br>\n      <br>\n      HARRY MONROE: The early months of Wilson\'s term were one of the most \n      successful times in the history of any president. The new president had \n      won the election by promising major reforms in the economic life of the \n      country. And he had kept that promise.<br>\n      <br>\n      The reforms were not only a victory for Woodrow Wilson. They also changed \n      the face of American business and economics for many years to come. The \n      income tax, for example, grew to become the federal government\'s main \n      source of money.<br>\n      <br>\n      KAY GALANT: Woodrow Wilson had taught history in the days when he was a \n      professor at Princeton University. He knew his actions as president could \n      influence the country for a long time. But, as a historian, he also knew \n      his own term in the White House could be changed by unexpected events. \n      That is just what happened.<br>\n      <br>\n      Wilson campaigned for president mainly on national issues. But he soon was \n      forced to spend more and more time on international issues. His first big \n      problem was across the United States\' southern border, in Mexico.

Many recessions \n      since the nineteen forties lasted less than a year.<br>\n      <br>\n      Another difference was the severity. The economy shrank by more than four \n      percent.

One questioner wondered if today\'s young Americans still could \n      hope for a good life.<br>\n      <br>\n      QUESTIONER: &quot;What I\'m really hoping to hear from you is several concrete \n      steps that you\'re going to take moving forward that will be able to \n      re-ignite my generation, re-ignite the youth who are beset by student \n      loans. And I really want to know, is the American Dream dead for me?&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      BARRACK OBAMA: &quot;Absolutely not. Look, we still have the best universities \n      in the world. We’ve got the most dynamic private sector in the world. \n      We\'ve got the most productive workers in the world. There is not a country \n      in the world that would not want to change places with us.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      But the economy could change the balance of power in Congress in the \n      November elections.<br>\n      <br>\n      Critics say the president\'s economic stimulus programs have only put the \n      country deeper in debt. Economists disagree about the extent to which the \n      spending has helped. But many agree that the president\'s policies avoided \n      a worse situation.<br>\n      <br>\n      Or, as Mr. Obama put it at the United Nations on Thursday: &quot;The global \n      economy has been pulled back from the brink of a depression.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      In Washington, central bank policy makers said inflation remains low. In \n      fact, they said it may be too low to support their aims for price and wage \n      stability.<br>\n      <br>\n      And, Lawrence Summers, director of the president\'s National Economic \n      Council, said he will leave at the end of the year to return to Harvard \n      University.<br>\n      <br>\n      And that\'s the VOA Special English Economics Report, written by Mario \n      Ritter.

Most of his days were spent working on his uncle’s farm, \n      picking cotton. He was a lonely and unhappy child. Roger began writing \n      songs because he loved the music he heard on the radio. He also learned to \n      play the guitar and the violin, sometimes called a fiddle. Much later, he \n      learned to play the drums.

He \n      traveled from town to town in the West. He worked at any job he could find \n      during the day.

He dreamed \n      of writing serious music.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: In nineteen thirty-three, Ralph entered a black university, \n      Tuskegee Institute, in the state of Alabama. He wanted to study music. He \n      moved to New York City in nineteen thirty-six. He still planned to study \n      music and art. However, that same year he ran out of money and could no \n      longer attend school.<br>\n      <br>\n      The nineteen thirties in America were difficult economic times. There were \n      not many jobs to be found, and even fewer for black men. Ellison worked at \n      many things. He shined people\'s shoes. He played trumpet in a jazz band. \n      He worked for the Young Men\'s Christian Association. He worked in \n      factories. He worked for a brief time taking pictures. Lack of money was \n      an important reason for Ralph Ellison becoming a writer. He said:<br>\n      <br>\n      READER: &quot;I have always read a lot, and I began to realize I had a certain \n      talent for it. It was not easy to be the kind of musician I wanted to be: \n      I did not have enough money to go to Juilliard [school of music]. So I \n      stuck with what I had.”<br>\n      <br>\n      BARBARA KLEIN: In New York City, Ellison joined the Federal Writers \n      Project. This was a program created during Franklin Roosevelt\'s presidency \n      to keep writers employed at writing.<br>\n      <br>\n      He met two important black writers, Langston Hughes and Richard Wright. \n      Wright soon would publish “Native Son,” the book that made him famous.<br>\n      <br>\n      Later, during World War Two, Ellison served as a cook in the United States \n      Merchant Marine. Merchant marine ships carried war supplies to American \n      and allied soldiers. For Ellison, the war was a time of learning and \n      trying to write.<br>\n      <br>\n      He read books by the American writers T.S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, and \n      William Faulkner. And he read books by foreign writers like the Irish \n      writer James Joyce.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: Ralph Ellison\'s stories were first published during World War \n      Two. When the war was over, he visited a friend in the state of Vermont. \n      Ellison said:<br>\n      <br>\n      READER: &quot;One day I wrote, \'I am an invisible man.’ I did not know what \n      those words represented at the start, and I had no thought about what gave \n      me the idea.&quot;<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101021171516.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          &quot;The \n          Invisible Man&quot; sculpture stands in front of the longtime home of \n          acclaimed author Ralph Ellison in New York\'s West Harlem.</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      STEVE EMBER: The book that \n      started with those words took almost seven years to write.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      BARBARA KLEIN: Like many other novels, Ellison\'s story is a series of \n      experiences as the storyteller learns to deal with life. Yet, unlike other \n      novels, “Invisible Man” takes place in a dream-like atmosphere in the \n      United States. It is a world where dreams come close to reality, and the \n      real world looks like a frightening dream.<br>\n      <br>\n      The man telling his story in “Invisible Man” lives in a hidden underground \n      space. But to prove that he exists, at least to himself, he has lit his \n      underground room with one thousand three hundred sixty-nine lights. They \n      remain lit with power he has stolen from the electric company.<br>\n      <br>\n      In much of Ellison\'s novel the person telling the story is a victim, \n      usually of white people, but also of some blacks. He both loves and hates \n      the world. He plans some day to leave his underground shelter. He says \n      that as a man he is willing to believe that &quot;even the invisible victim is \n      responsible for the fate of all.”<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: The man telling the story says that as a boy, white men \n      covered his eyes with a cloth. The white men tell the boy to blindly fight \n      other black boys. The blacks are forced to fight each other to please \n      whites.<br>\n      <br>\n      At the end of the novel the story has moved from the American South to the \n      North. There are riots in Harlem, the black area of New York City. Instead \n      of ten black children fighting each other blindly, grown black men are \n      battling each other to the death. Blacks still are having their strength \n      turned upon themselves.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      BARBARA KLEIN: Critics said “Invisible Man” was well written. But some \n      critics called this a weakness. They said the writing seemed to hide the \n      book\'s ideas and make them less a product of black life.<br>\n      <br>\n      One critic said that he found it difficult to call “Invisible Man” an \n      African-American novel. He said that the main person in the book is a \n      southern black man. But, the critic said, he is all of us, no matter where \n      we were born or the color of our skin.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: After “Invisible Man” was published in nineteen fifty-two, \n      Ralph Ellison taught at a number of universities. He retired from New York \n      University in nineteen eighty. While he was alive, he published only two \n      other books. They were books of criticism and essays, called “Shadow and \n      Act” and “Going to the Territory.”<br>\n      <br>\n      Ralph Ellison died in nineteen ninety-four, at the age of eighty. After \n      his death, a book of his stories, “Flying Home,” was published. Shortly \n      before his death, Ellison had told someone that his second novel was \n      almost finished. He had worked on the novel for forty years without \n      finishing it.<br>\n      <br>\n      Parts of the book had appeared in magazines during the nineteen sixties \n      and seventies. Ellison had to rewrite the novel after a large part of it \n      was burned in a fire at his home in nineteen sixty-seven. The novel was \n      said to be two thousand pages long. Finally, his friend John Callahan put \n      the book together after Ellison died. The novel was published in nineteen \n      ninety-nine. It was called “Juneteenth.”<br>\n      <br>\n      BARBARA KLEIN: Since “Invisible Man” was published, many American writers \n      have said how much Ellison influenced them.<br>\n      <br>\n      In nineteen ninety, another black writer, Charles Johnson, was given the \n      National Book Award. In receiving the prize, Johnson thanked Ralph Ellison \n      for leading the way for black writers. Ellison was present at the \n      ceremony. He thanked Johnson. Then he expressed his belief that black \n      writers should not be influenced only by other black writers. He said:<br>\n      <br>\n      READER: &quot;You do not write out of your skin. You write out of your ideas \n      and the quality of your mind.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: This program was written by Richard Thorman and produced by \n      Lawan Davis.

That \n      organization, based in the United States, held the first World Mental \n      Health Day in nineteen ninety-two.<br>\n      <br>\n      Mrs. Berger says mental health problems are most severe in poor countries \n      that lack the resources to deal with them.<br>\n      <br>\n      ELENA BERGER: &quot;It\'s an enormous issue. The World Health Organization is \n      highlighting mental health as a neglected issue. In developing countries, \n      a huge number of people, up to eighty-five percent, don\'t have access to \n      any form of mental health treatment. There are huge staffing needs.

In two thousand two, the World Health Organization \n      estimated that more than one hundred fifty-four million people suffered \n      from depression.<br>\n      <br>\n      But Elena Berger from the mental health federation says other kinds of \n      diseases often get more attention.<br>\n      <br>\n      ELENA BERGER: &quot;People are more focused on communicable diseases and not \n      paying enough attention to the amount of disability there is from mental \n      health conditions.

She pretends to be a Southern lady \n      with high morals.<br>\n      <br>\n      But the truth is she was fired from a teaching job because she had sex \n      with a teenage student. She was thrown out of a hotel for having sex with \n      many different men. She also has lost her house and land and has no money. \n      She drinks a lot of alcohol, but tries to hide it from everyone.

Others had some level of \n      success, but not enough to have a measurable effect on the lives of people \n      in developing countries.<br>\n      <br>\n      A nonprofit group in New York called MobileActive held the first FAILFaire \n      earlier this year. MobileActive is made up of people and organizations \n      that use technology to try to improve the lives of the poor.<br>\n      <br>\n      Katrin Verclas came up with the idea for FAILFaire as a way to help \n      nonprofit groups improve by learning from the mistakes of others.<br>\n      <br>\n      Katrin Verclas: &quot;The primary goal is to learn from failure and not to \n      repeat the same mistakes over and over again. And for a community of \n      practitioners to benefit from the lessons learned from other people so \n      that we can do better the next time around, collectively as a field, and \n      individually as organizations and practitioners.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      Katrin Verclas says there are many reasons why projects fail, but one \n      reason tops all others. She says development projects are not &quot;one size \n      fits all,&quot; yet many people try to import ideas as if they were.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/201010102117148.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"110\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Members \n          of the charity Oxfam demonstrate outside a meeting of European Union \n          finance ministers in Brussels earlier this month. &quot;Bankers,&quot; left, and \n          &quot;nongovernmental organizations,&quot; right, fight over a giant euro note.</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      What they fail to consider, \n      she says, is the desires of the local people or their cultural, economic \n      and political differences. She says the problem for many nongovernmental \n      organizations and other groups is simply not knowing their audience.<br>\n      <br>\n      Katrin Verclas: &quot;Western organizations, or NGOs, or donors in particular \n      have particular ideas about what might be alleviating a particular problem \n      in a developing country, without a really good understanding of the end \n      users or the beneficiaries.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      The creator of FAILFaire says this is true not only with technology but \n      other projects as well. Ms. Verclas hopes nonprofits in other industries \n      and fields will create their own versions of FAILFaire.<br>\n      <br>\n      A second FAILFaire took place in July in Washington. The World Bank \n      Institute co-sponsored the event. To Katrin Verclas, it was a good sign to \n      have the World Bank support such open discussions about failure.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/201010102117149.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          A Somali \n          policeman helps a displaced Somali woman to carry food aid provided by \n          a local NGO and the World Food Program in Mogadishu in May</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      Katrin Verclas: &quot;We have a \n      lot riding on this, after all. It\'s not just products; it\'s people\'s lives \n      and well-being and livelihoods in many developing countries that we\'re \n      talking about. So it\'s incumbent upon us to be very, very honest about \n      what projects aren\'t performing according to expectations.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      An award for the best worst failure story went to Michael Trucano from the \n      World Bank Institute. What he presented was in fact a list. It was a list \n      of what he considers the worst practices in the use of information and \n      communication technologies in education.<br>\n      <br>\n      Mr. Trucano gets to keep the award until the next FAILFaire, which is \n      expected to be held on the West Coast this fall.

I\'m Steve Ember with Shirley Griffith. \n      This week, come along to one of the most beautiful and historic cities in \n      the United States -- Charleston, South Carolina. The Civil War began at \n      its waterfront.<br>\n      <br>\n      Charleston is on a piece of land in the southeastern United States that \n      points like a finger to the Atlantic Ocean. Rivers flow by either side of \n      the city.

They know this is not true, but \n      they like to tell the story anyway.

It is the only city in \n      the United States that can claim to have defended itself from American \n      Indians, fierce pirates, Spanish ships, French soldiers, and British \n      forces. It was first in many things. Charleston had the first continual \n      train service in the United States.<br>\n      <br>\n      It built the first museum and the first public flower garden in America. \n      And the first battle of the American Civil War took place on a very small \n      but important island in its port.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/201010102117122.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"113\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Tourists \n          on a carriage tour in Charleston in February.

One critic has called \n      Charleston the most friendly city in the United States. Charleston is all \n      of these things and much more.<br>\n      <br>\n      SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Plan your visit to Charleston for early spring, late \n      autumn or the winter months. The citizens of Charleston will tell you \n      their lovely city is not fun in the summer. It is extremely hot. The \n      summer heat is important to the history of Charleston.<br>\n      <br>\n      Early settlers owned huge farms called plantations. In the seventeen \n      hundreds, these farms produced a plant called indigo which is used to make \n      cloth the color blue.<br>\n      <br>\n      Many plantation owners forced slaves to do the work needed to grow indigo \n      in the extreme heat. Slavery became important to the economy of \n      Charleston. The plantations, indigo and slavery are part of the history of \n      the city.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: At least three Indian tribes were living in the area that \n      became Charleston when Spanish explorers arrived in Fifteen-Twenty-One. \n      The Spanish explorers, and later, French explorers tried to establish \n      settlements near that area but none lasted.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/201010102117123.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Shoppers \n          at the City Market in Charleston</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      English settlers first came \n      to the area in sixteen seventy. They established a town. They called it \n      Charles Town in honor of the English King, Charles the Second. The people \n      of the city changed its name to Charleston in seventeen eighty-three.<br>\n      <br>\n      SHIRLEY GRIFFITH:<br>\n      <br>\n      Many people came to live in Charleston because it produced indigo and had \n      a good port. The people who settled the area were hard working and \n      independent. They considered themselves citizens of England.<br>\n      <br>\n      Still, they did not like some of the laws declared by the English \n      government. The colonists successfully defended their city many times in \n      the early seventeen hundreds. They defended it against both French and \n      Spanish forces, and against raids by Yamasee Indians and by pirates.<br>\n      <br>\n      In seventeen nineteen, the citizens of Charleston rebelled against the \n      group of English men who controlled their colony. They wanted more \n      self-government. Britain\'s King George agreed. This change gave the people \n      of Charleston a feeling of independence.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: Charleston is still proud of its part in the war for \n      independence. The city provided several political and military leaders \n      during the American Revolution.<br>\n      <br>\n      British forces attacked it two times, but were defeated by the people of \n      Charleston. The third time, the British captured the city and held it for \n      more than a year.<br>\n      <br>\n      Charleston continued to grow after the American colonists had won their \n      independence from England. The new federal government knew that the city \n      was important.<br>\n      <br>\n      Workers began building a strong base to guard Charleston in eighteen \n      twenty-eight. This base was on a small island in Charleston Harbor. It was \n      named Fort Sumter. It was designed to guard the city from any future \n      enemy.<br>\n      <br>\n      SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: There were no thoughts of war or future enemies while \n      Fort Sumter was being built. The plantations near Charleston had began to \n      plant new crops like rice and cotton.<br>\n      <br>\n      With the help of slave labor, cotton became extremely important to the \n      economy of Charleston and much of the South. Many people in the northern \n      United States began to think that slavery was very wrong, however.<br>\n      <br>\n      Slave owners in the South wanted things to remain as they had always been. \n      They believed the federal government had no right to tell them what they \n      could or could not do.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: A national crisis began when Abraham Lincoln was elected \n      president in eighteen sixty. The people of South Carolina believed he \n      would try to end slavery by force. They voted to leave the United States. \n      They were quickly followed by other southern states. These southern states \n      soon created the government of the Confederate States of America.<br>\n      <br>\n      Federal troops controlled Fort Sumter when South Carolina voted to leave \n      the Union.

Several major battles were fought there. Late in the war another \n      battle for control of Fort Sumter continued for almost two years. Much of \n      Charleston had been destroyed by the time the war ended. Rebuilding the \n      city was a long and slow process.<br>\n      <br>\n      The people of Charleston tried to save the historic buildings from the \n      seventeen hundreds. They wanted to keep those buildings they felt were an \n      important part of their city.<br>\n      <br>\n      The huge plantations near Charleston were also in need of rebuilding. Many \n      owners failed in their efforts because they could no longer use slave \n      labor. Their farms became much smaller.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: The historic buildings of Charleston were affected by weather \n      as well as wars. Through the years, ocean storms have severely damaged the \n      city. A major storm struck Charleston in September nineteen-eighty-nine. \n      It killed eighteen people and caused more than three-thousand-million \n      dollars in damage.<br>\n      <br>\n      The huge storm had winds of more than two hundred seventeen kilometers an \n      hour. It caused high waves that severely flooded city streets.<br>\n      <br>\n      SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: The federal, state and city governments and individual \n      citizens have spent millions of dollars to rebuild and repair historic \n      areas. So in some places, Charleston looks a lot like it has for several \n      hundred years.<br>\n      <br>\n      In the center of the city are stores in small one-hundred year old \n      buildings. The same family has owned one of the stores for almost one \n      hundred fifty years. Fine eating places throughout the city serve southern \n      food.<br>\n      <br>\n      The people of Charleston will tell you they have some of the best eating \n      places in the United States. Many visitors agree.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: Beautiful, old buildings are a major reason thousands of \n      people visit Charleston each year. One of the famous buildings is the Old \n      Exchange and Provost Dungeon. It was built in the early seventeen \n      hundreds. It was a jail that held the famous English pirate Stede Bonnet \n      and his crew before they were hanged.<br>\n      <br>\n      Several of the old plantation farms near Charleston also are open to \n      visitors. One is called Boone Hall Plantation. It is still a working farm. \n      Boone Hall Plantation looks much like it did before the American Civil \n      War. It has been used as the setting for a number of movies and television \n      programs about the American South and the Civil War.<br>\n      <br>\n      SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: From almost anywhere along the waterfront in Charleston, \n      you can see a large American flag flying over the small island that still \n      holds Fort Sumter. Most visitors go to the historic fort during their time \n      in Charleston. Several companies provide boat rides to the fort.<br>\n      <br>\n      Much of the fort was destroyed during the Civil War. But what remains of \n      Fort Sumter is protected by the National Park Service. Park workers meet \n      each boat and explain about the battles that took place.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: Charleston has many interesting places to visit. However the \n      people who live in the city really make it special. They are extremely \n      friendly in a way that is part of the culture of the American south. The \n      people of Charleston continue to keep their city beautiful using modern \n      technology to protect their historic past.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      Our program was written by Paul Thompson and produced by Lawan Davis. \n      Internet users can read and listen to our reports at voaspecialenglish.com. \n      With Shirley Griffith, I\'m Steve Ember.

I wanted the people to wander around in agonizing  limbo &hellip;you know, like in real life. Naturally, nobody is going to pay to  see this,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut audiences, indeed, do pay to see the films at the TIFF, as the  Festival is known locally. It\'s a terrific experience for directors like  Andrew Lau, who arrived from Hong Kong just in time for the North  American premiere of his martial arts drama &quot;Legend of the Fist: The  Return of Chen Zhen&quot;. &quot;I was very happy. When I jumped out of the car I  saw all the people outside the theater and I said &quot;oh, this is  wonderful,&quot; because a director loves to see that kind of thing: a long  queue &hellip;we love that kind of things, so I\'m so happy about that,&quot; he  said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCameron Bailey, who is co-director of the TIFF, said &quot;We have over 300  films at the Festival. About 260 of those are feature films, 122 of them  are world premieres and they are from over 60 countries.&quot; Bailey heads a  team of 20 programmers who scour the world every year for new films  from veteran directors and first-timers. Bailey says they stress the  &quot;international&quot; part of the festival title and it is something Canadian  audiences welcome:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I think we pride ourselves on being open-minded and curious about the  rest of the world. We are not as inward looking as, maybe, some other  countries &hellip;partly because, I think, particularly Toronto is such a  diverse city. The majority of the population is people who were not born  in Toronto, so we are outward looking. We are curious to see what the  world is bringing to us and I think we pride ourselves on being engaged  with the world, being fair minded, having a kind of ironic sense of  humor about things (and) certainly never taking ourselves too seriously.  I think you\'ll find that in the audiences at the movies here at the  Festival,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIrish writer-director Juanita Wilson was particularly moved by the  audience response to her film &quot;As If I Am Not There,&quot; a heartbreaking  drama about women forced to be sex slaves during the war in Bosnia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;There was a Bosnian couple who came up to talk to me. They had left  because of the war and the woman was saying that she couldn\'t even  listen to music from home because it was so sad and so upsetting. Yet  she felt coming to this film was going to open a new chapter in her  life. Things like that matter so much to me; and you make films for this  reason, not for the awards and not for the reviews. You actually make  it so that you can touch the hearts of real people and when you do it is  such a privilege that you can do that when people are open to it. It  just reaffirms the power of cinema,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe early autumn dates position the TIFF as a major springboard for the  annual awards season. Recent Toronto favorites like &quot;American Beauty,&quot;  &quot;Juno,&quot; &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; and &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; went on to win  Oscars. However, it is also a chance to spotlight new, smaller films.  South African-born German director Oliver Schmitz brought his powerful  drama of a teenager\'s struggle to keep her family together, &quot;Life Above  All:&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, whenever filmmakers gather, they \'do lunch,\' as they say:  hold informal business meetings that can lead to a film being picked up  for distribution in markets around the world or, as Oliver Schmitz  points out, also pave the way for new projects:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I think the best scenario for any film festival is to have one film  that is screening and another one which is ready to shoot and looking  for that final financing. It is what happened this year in Cannes on a  project that I\'m shooting in Germany next year and Paramount is part of  that project so that was fantastic. Now I\'m concentrating on the movie,  but already I\'ve had meetings this morning, which will lead to other  things,&quot; he said. &quot;So the best thing, actually, is to have something  that people can see and take note of and then say \'hey, I also have this  other project.\'<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFestival official Bailey says the crowded theaters and backroom meetings  are not his main measures of success for the film showcase.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We do have quantitative measures we can look at: the number of pictures  that are sold, the number of premieres that we have, the number of  tickets sold, as well. But I think what I often do is I like to stand in  the back of a theater with a filmmaker and just see how he or she  reacts to the film. If they are watching the audience and the audience  is into it and the filmmaker is pleased by that and this is an  experience that they haven\'t had yet - this is the world premiere of  their film and they\'re loving it and if they\'ll come back as a result  with their next film, then that\'s success for me,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCameron Bailey is co-director of the 35th annual Toronto International Film Festival.</span></p>','http://down02.putclub.com/voanews/audio/2010/09/19/silverman_toronto_film_festival_feature_cut_17sep10-32b.mp3');

Also, Japan recently intervened in markets to push down the value of its currency, the yen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZoellick says the tensions grow out of the slow and uneven economic recovery, which is leaving millions of people out of work. &quot;Whenever you have high unemployment, you have risks of other tensions, we see this now in debates on currencies.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving a weaker currency can help cut unemployment by boosting exports.

But it also is a story of fierce struggle and lost \n      hopes. It is a story that begins across America\'s southern border--in \n      Mexico.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532955.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"113\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Woodrow \n          Wilson and his cabinet seated around table, 1913</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      MAURICE JOYCE: At that time, \n      Mexico had been ruled for many years by Porfirio Diaz. As Diaz grew older, \n      his power began to weaken. In nineteen eleven, a revolt broke out. It was \n      led by Francisco Madero, the leader of a land reform movement. Diaz \n      understood he could not win. He resigned and fled the country.<br>\n      <br>\n      Madero declared himself president. However, powerful groups in Mexico \n      opposed him. In a short time, one of his own generals, Victoriano Huerta, \n      arrested him. Madero was murdered soon after Huerta seized power.<br>\n      <br>\n      President Wilson refused to recognize Huerta\'s government. He believed \n      other forces would rise up against him. Wilson was right. Another revolt \n      began, led by General Venustiano Carranza.<br>\n      <br>\n      LARRY WEST: Wilson offered aid to Carranza. Carranza rejected the offer. \n      He was afraid of American interference in Mexico. He told Wilson that \n      Mexican troops would do all the fighting. He only wanted guns and \n      ammunition.<br>\n      <br>\n      American forces did, however, get involved in the conflict. President \n      Wilson learned that a ship from Germany was bringing supplies to the \n      Huerta government. The ship would land at the Mexican port of Vera Cruz. \n      Wilson ordered the United States Navy to seize and occupy the port. The \n      move started a storm of criticism in the United States and throughout \n      Latin America.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      MAURICE JOYCE: Many people denounced President Wilson. They called him an \n      imperialist and a fool. They asked: what right did the United States have \n      to interfere in Mexico. Wilson finally stopped American military action in \n      Mexico. He tried to settle the dispute at an international conference at \n      Niagara Falls, Canada. The effort failed. The conference did not produce a \n      settlement.<br>\n      <br>\n      While the diplomats were talking, Carranza\'s revolutionary forces were \n      fighting. They moved on Mexico City, the capital. President Huerta fled. \n      Carranza formed a new government.<br>\n      <br>\n      LARRY WEST: The new government began to split apart almost immediately. \n      Another general, Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa, tried to seize power. He forced \n      Carranza out of Mexico City. Then he formed his own government. President \n      Wilson recognized Villa and his government.<br>\n      <br>\n      Carranza, however, refused to give up. Day by day, his army grew stronger. \n      He forced Villa to retreat. Then President Wilson recognized Carranza\'s \n      government. Like Carranza, Villa refused to give up. He decided to try to \n      start a war between Mexico and the United States.<br>\n      <br>\n      Pancho Villa wanted the United States to attack Carranza. Then he would \n      step in to lead Mexican forces in battle. That would make him a hero. With \n      this plan in mind, Pancho Villa attacked an American town across the \n      border in Texas. He killed nineteen persons.<br>\n      <br>\n      MAURICE JOYCE: President Wilson immediately ordered a large American force \n      to find and punish Villa. At first, Carranza welcomed the move. Villa was \n      his enemy. He wanted him captured. Then Carranza began to fear that the \n      American troops might threaten his government. He demanded the withdrawal \n      of all American soldiers from Mexico.<br>\n      <br>\n      Tensions increased between the two countries. Villa\'s forces attacked \n      another town in Texas. President Wilson considered asking Congress to \n      declare war. But the crisis cooled down before then. American forces were \n      withdrawn. And the people of Mexico elected a new government. They chose \n      Carranza as president.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      LARRY WEST: As President Wilson dealt with the situation in Mexico, \n      trouble began to surface in another part of the world. The crisis was in \n      Europe. Tensions were growing between several groups of nations. They were \n      on the edge of what would become World War One.<br>\n      <br>\n      The major powers in Europe had been threatening each other for years. But \n      they had not fought for more than forty years. Most Americans believed \n      there would never be another European war. Such a war would be \n      unbelievably destructive. Millions would die. No nation would win.<br>\n      <br>\n      MAURICE JOYCE: Europe depended on a balance of power to keep the peace. On \n      one side were the central powers -- Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. \n      On the other side were the members of the triple entente -- Britain, \n      France, and Russia.<br>\n      <br>\n      Each side made every effort to win the support of Europe\'s smaller \n      nations. A number of nations refused to join either side. The neutrals \n      included Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian \n      countries.<br>\n      <br>\n      LARRY WEST: This political balance did not prevent the major nations from \n      competing with each other for colonies and economic power. They competed \n      all over the world. In China, in the Middle East, in Africa -- everywhere \n      money could be invested. Competition was especially sharp in the Balkans. \n      This was the area of Europe between the Adriatic and Black Seas.<br>\n      <br>\n      Many nations claimed special interests in the Balkans. And several Balkan \n      countries were fighting each other. The whole continent seemed ready to \n      explode.<br>\n      <br>\n      MAURICE JOYCE: The spark that set off the explosion came in the city of \n      Sarajevo. The date was June twenty-eighth, nineteen fourteen. Sarajevo had \n      been taken over by Austria. And the Archduke of Austria -- Ferdinand -- \n      had come for a visit. Ferdinand was expected to become the next emperor of \n      Austria.<br>\n      <br>\n      Seven young extremists from the area decided to assassinate the Archduke \n      to protest Austrian control. One of the extremists threw a bomb at the \n      royal family. The bomb missed its target. But another extremist shot at \n      the group. He killed both the Archduke and the Archduke\'s wife.<br>\n      <br>\n      LARRY WEST: The assassinations in Sarajevo started a series of events that \n      quickly brought war to all of Europe. Soon the continent was covered with \n      armies, battles, and death. The war in Europe forced President Wilson to \n      face the greatest crisis of his presidency.<br>\n      <br>\n      That will be our story next week.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: Our program was written by Frank Beardsley.

It showed that B vitamins \n      caused an average one-third reduction in brain shrinkage among adults who \n      had trouble remembering.<br>\n      <br>\n      Retired Oxford University pharmacology professor David Smith was a leader \n      of the study. He praised the use of the vitamins as simple and safe. He \n      also said researchers do not yet know if B vitamins could prevent or slow \n      Alzheimer’s disease.<br>\n      <br>\n      A report about the Oxford study appeared in PLoS One, a publication of the \n      Public Library of Science.<br>\n      <br>\n      FAITH LAPIDUS: Vitamins are important for good health. These complex \n      organic substances help to carry out chemical changes within cells. If we \n      do not get enough of the vitamins we need in our food, we are at risk of \n      developing a number of diseases.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532956.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"113\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          MRI \n          scans showing brains of two patients in the Oxford study.

Yet studies have shown \n      a link between a larger shrinkage and Alzheimer’s disease.<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: The Oxford researchers tested one hundred sixty-eight people \n      over twenty-four months. All of those tested were over age seventy. One \n      group in the study took B vitamins every day. They swallowed tablets \n      containing folic acid, vitamin B-6 and vitamin B-12. A second group took \n      placebos -- harmless substances that did not contain the vitamins or folic \n      acid.<br>\n      <br>\n      Two years later, the researchers used magnetic resonance imaging tests to \n      study both groups. They also tested the thought processes of each person. \n      Those taking the vitamins had up to fifty percent less brain shrinkage \n      than those taking the placebos.<br>\n      <br>\n      FAITH LAPIDUS: Professor Smith says the researchers chose B vitamins for \n      the study because they control homocysteine, an amino acid in the blood. \n      Earlier studies have linked high homocysteine levels to a greater risk of \n      Alzheimer’s.<br>\n      <br>\n      The Oxford researchers say about one in six people over age seventy has \n      problems with mental operations. They say half of these people develop \n      serious loss of mental ability, as in Alzheimer’s disease. Over time, the \n      disease robs people of their memories. Finally, it takes away their \n      ability to care for themselves.<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: Rebecca Wood is chief officer of the Alzheimer\'s Research \n      Trust in London. She described the results of the study as important. \n      However, she said an extended study should be made of people who might be \n      expected to develop Alzheimer\'s.<br>\n      <br>\n      Professor Smith had a warning for older adults worried about memory loss. \n      He said they should talk to their doctors before starting to take the \n      vitamins. He said the vitamins could speed the growth of some cancers.<br>\n      <br>\n      FAITH LAPIDUS: In two thousand eight, the Journal of the American Medical \n      Association published a study of older patients with mild to moderate \n      Alzheimer’s disease. Three hundred forty people took part in the study. Of \n      those, two hundred two took vitamins. One hundred thirty eight others got \n      placebos.<br>\n      <br>\n      The results did not show a difference in loss of abilities such as \n      attention, language and memory. That was true whether or not the people \n      took the vitamins.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: In other research news, American scientists say people with a \n      special marker in their genes develop Alzheimer\'s faster than others. The \n      journal PLoS Genetics published the finding of a scientific team from \n      Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri.<br>\n      <br>\n      The scientists said a change of a gene that governs a protein known as tau \n      strongly influences the rate at which the disease develops. Other studies \n      have linked the tau protein to the development of Alzheimer\'s.<br>\n      <br>\n      FAITH LAPIDUS: The recently announced World Alzheimer Report places a \n      shocking financial cost on care linked to dementia, or loss of mental \n      abilities. Alzheimer\'s is the most common of the dementia diseases. The \n      report says dementia will cost the world six hundred four billion dollars \n      this year. That is more than one percent of the world’s total amount of \n      money from goods and services.<br>\n      <br>\n      The report urges the World Health Organization to make loss of mental \n      abilities a cause of major interest. Campaigners say more investment in \n      care and research is necessary.<br>\n      <br>\n      Martin Prince of Britain\'s Institute of Psychiatry, at King\'s College in \n      London, was a writer of the report. Professor Prince said nations around \n      the world need to develop better plans for caring for the millions who \n      have the disease.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: You are listening to the VOA Special English program SCIENCE \n      IN THE NEWS.

These creatures lived more than sixty-five \n      million years ago, during Earth\'s late Cretaceous period.<br>\n      <br>\n      The triceratops is famous for having three horns growing on its head. The \n      scientists say the two newly discovered dinosaurs had even more horns. \n      They say the smaller of the two had fifteen horns. There was one over its \n      nose, one on each cheekbone and one above each eye. There were also ten \n      horns along the edge at the back of its skull.<br>\n      <br>\n      FAITH LAPIDUS: The scientific team that found this horny creature has \n      named it Kosmoceratops richardsoni. Kosmo is a Latin word that means \n      ornate or very detailed. Ceretops means horned face. Richarsoni was added \n      in honor of a volunteer named Scott Richardson. He found two skulls of \n      this animal at the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, in \n      southern Utah.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532958.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          \n          Researchers working on a horn of Kosmoceratops richardsoni</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      PLoS One published a report \n      about the discovery. Paleontologist Scott Sampson was the lead writer of \n      the report. He says the huge skull and many horns of Kosmoceratops make it \n      one of the most amazing animals ever found. He believes the creature used \n      its horns to frighten off members of the same sex, and to interest members \n      of the opposite sex.<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: The second newly discovered species was named Utahceratops \n      gettyi. Its remains were also found in Utah. Mike Getty is a paleontology \n      collection manager at the Utah Museum of Natural History. He also \n      discovered this animal.<br>\n      <br>\n      The skull of the Utahceratops was two and three tenths meters long. It had \n      one horn on each side of its head, short sideways facing horns above each \n      eye, and one horn above its nose. The dinosaur stood about two meters tall \n      at its shoulder and hips, and was between six and seven meters long.<br>\n      <br>\n      FAITH LAPIDUS: The dinosaur remains were discovered in an area called the \n      lost island continent of Laramidia. Scientists say it formed when high sea \n      levels flooded the middle of North America, splitting the continent in two \n      for millions of years during the late Cretaceous period.<br>\n      <br>\n      The eastern landmass was called Appalachia. The western land mass was \n      known as Laramidia. It reached from what is now New Mexico to Alberta, \n      Canada. Utah is now in what was the southern part of Laramidia.<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: The Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument covers seven \n      hundred seventy hectares of land in southern Utah.<br>\n      <br>\n      Scott Sampson says it is one of the last great dinosaur bone-yards in the \n      United States. He also says this is an exciting time for paleontologists. \n      Over the past twelve years, scientists have discovered more than ten \n      dinosaur species in the area. Most of those found were from species new to \n      scientists.<br>\n      <br>\n      The Utah Museum of Natural History is showing the skulls of the newly \n      discovered dinosaurs through the end of the year. They will become part of \n      the museum\'s permanent collection when it moves to a new building next \n      year.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      FAITH LAPIDUS: This SCIENCE IN THE NEWS was written by Jerilyn Watson and \n      June Simms, who was also our producer.

First, they had to agree on which conflict was their most \n      recent.<br>\n      <br>\n      The husbands and wives each had to choose from a list of behaviors to \n      describe the strategies they used. The list included behaviors like calm \n      discussion, listening and trying hard to find out the other person\'s \n      feelings.<br>\n      <br>\n      The list also included behaviors like yelling, using insults, walking away \n      or not communicating -- in other words, the silent treatment.<br>\n      <br>\n      Assistant professor Kira Birditt led the study.<br>\n      <br>\n      KIRA BIRDITT: &quot;The husbands were more likely to use the constructive \n      strategies like discussing the problem, finding solutions, and wives were \n      more likely to use those destructive or withdrawal strategies.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      But Professor Birditt says the study found that over time, wives became \n      less destructive in the way they argued. Husbands stayed the same.<br>\n      <br>\n      KIRA BIRDITT: &quot;It looked like wives got better at dealing with conflict \n      over time using the fewer destructive and withdrawal strategies.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      She says the researchers also found that different combinations of \n      strategies may help predict whether a couple will stay together.

Burt turned to his brother and asked a \n      wild question: &quot;How would you like to be the first person to fly around \n      the world without stopping to re-fuel?&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      The three considered the idea. A non-stop flight around the world without \n      re-fueling was the last flight record to be set. The flight always had \n      been considered impossible. No plane could carry enough fuel to fly that \n      far: forty thousand kilometers.<br>\n      <br>\n      But now there were new materials for planes. Burt thought he could build a \n      plane that could make the voyage. Dick and Jeana thought they could fly \n      it. No one could think of a good reason not to try.<br>\n      <br>\n      Burt picked up a small piece of paper. He drew an airplane that looked \n      like a giant wing, and not much more. That was the beginning.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      FRANK OLIVER: Not since the days of Orville and Wilbur Wright had the \n      people making a record flight designed and built their own aircraft. Dick, \n      Burt and Jeana did. Some people thought their Voyager project was both \n      impossible and foolish. Everyone knew it would be dangerous.<br>\n      <br>\n      The Voyager crew worked on the plane in a small building at an airport in \n      California\'s Mojave Desert. Dick, Burt and Jeana received no government \n      money. Instead, they got small amounts of money from lots of different \n      people.<br>\n      <br>\n      As news of the project spread, more and more people offered to help. There \n      were aviation engineers and workers from the space agency\'s experimental \n      plane project. Several airplane companies offered equipment to be used in \n      the plane. When Voyager was finished, it had two million dollars\' worth of \n      parts in it.<br>\n      <br>\n      DOUG JOHNSON: Burt Rutan had built light-weight planes before. He knew a \n      normal plane made of aluminum metal could not make a trip around the world \n      without adding fuel. So his solution was to build Voyager almost \n      completely out of new materials. The materials were very light, but very \n      strong. This meant Voyager could lift and carry many times its weight in \n      fuel.<br>\n      <br>\n      The finished plane weighed just nine hundred kilograms, about the weight \n      of a small car. The full load of fuel weighed three times that much, about \n      three thousand kilograms. Voyager was not built to be a fast plane. It \n      flew about one hundred seventy-five kilometers an hour.<br>\n      <br>\n      FRANK OLIVER: The main wing of the finished plane was more than \n      thirty-three meters across. That is wider than the main wing on today\'s \n      big passenger planes. The center part of the plane held the crew. And on \n      either side of this body were two long fuel tanks.<br>\n      <br>\n      In fact, almost all of the Voyager was a fuel tank. Seventeen separate \n      containers were squeezed into every possible space. During the flight, the \n      pilots had to move fuel from container to container to keep the plane \n      balanced. One engine at each end of the body of the plane provided power.<br>\n      <br>\n      The area for the two pilots was unbelievably small. It was just one meter \n      wide by two-and-one-quarter meters long. The person flying the plane sat \n      in the pilot\'s seat. The other person had to lie down at all times.<br>\n      <br>\n      DOUG JOHNSON: After many test flights, the Voyager was finally ready in \n      December, nineteen eighty-six. The best weather for flying around the \n      world is from June to August. That time was far past. But the pilots were \n      tired of delays. They made the decision to Take off, knowing the weather \n      might be bad.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532752.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"183\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Jeana \n          Yeager and Dick Rutan</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      On December fourteenth, Dick \n      Rutan and Jeana Yeager walked around the plane one more time. It looked \n      like a giant white flying insect. They were going to be trusting their \n      lives to this strange plane for the next nine days.<br>\n      <br>\n      Dick climbed into the only seat. Jeana lay on the floor. They were ready \n      to go. Flight controllers at Edwards Air Force Base in California cleared \n      them for a trip no one had ever attempted before.<br>\n      <br>\n      FRANK OLIVER: The long, thin wings of the plane were so loaded with fuel \n      that they almost touched the ground. Voyager began to move down the \n      runway, slowly. But something was wrong. The ends of the wings were not \n      lifting.<br>\n      <br>\n      Burt Rutan sent a radio message to his brother to lift the plane\'s nose. \n      &quot;Pull back on the stick!&quot; he screamed. &quot;Pull back!&quot; But Dick did not hear \n      the warning. And he did not see the wings. He was looking straight ahead.<br>\n      <br>\n      Voyager was getting dangerously close to the end of the runway. It \n      appeared about to crash. Finally, just in time, the long wings swept up. \n      The plane leaped into the air.<br>\n      <br>\n      Planes following Voyager could see that the ends of the wings were badly \n      damaged. Dick turned the plane so the force of air currents would break \n      off the broken ends. Then he aimed Voyager out over the Pacific Ocean.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      DOUG JOHNSON: Weight was the main consideration in designing the \n      experimental plane. Not safety. Not comfort. Voyager did not have most of \n      the normal safety equipment of modern planes. There were no special \n      materials to block the noise of the engines. And space for the pilots was \n      so tight they had great difficulty changing places.<br>\n      <br>\n      Voyager\'s long wings moved up and down as the winds changed. It seemed to \n      sail on waves of air, just like a sailboat on ocean waves. This motion \n      meant the flight was extremely rough.<br>\n      <br>\n      FRANK OLIVER: It was not an enjoyable trip. Dick and Jeana were always \n      tense. At the end of the second day, the weather expert for the flight \n      warned of trouble. Voyager was heading for an ocean storm. Dick was able \n      to fly close to the storm and ride its winds.<br>\n      <br>\n      On the third day, Voyager was in trouble again. It had to fly between huge \n      thunderhead clouds on one side and Vietnam\'s airspace on the other. Dick \n      was able to keep the plane safely in the middle.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532753.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Voyager \n          in flight</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      Over Africa, the two pilots \n      struggled with continuous stormy weather. Dick had flown almost all of the \n      first sixty hours of the flight. Then he changed places with Jeana for \n      short periods. Both were extremely tired.<br>\n      <br>\n      Suddenly, a red warning light turned on. It was a signal that there was \n      not enough oil in one engine. Dick and Jeana had been so busy trying to \n      fly around bad weather and mountains that they had forgotten to watch the \n      oil level. But luck stayed with them.<br>\n      <br>\n      They added the necessary oil. The engine was not damaged.<br>\n      <br>\n      DOUG JOHNSON: Once past the violent weather over Africa, Dick and Jeana \n      began planning the way home. A computer confirmed that they had enough \n      fuel left to make it. But as they flew up the coast of Mexico, the engine \n      on the back of the plane failed. Fuel had stopped flowing to it.<br>\n      <br>\n      The more powerful front engine already had been shut down earlier to save \n      fuel. With neither engine working, Voyager quickly began to lose speed and \n      height. The plane fell for five minutes. Dick finally got the front engine \n      started again. Then fuel started flowing to the back engine, and it began \n      to work again, too.<br>\n      <br>\n      FRANK OLIVER: Nine days after take-off, Voyager landed smoothly at Edwards \n      Air Force Base in California. It had completed a Forty thousand kilometer \n      flight around the world. It had not stopped. And it had not re-fueled.<br>\n      <br>\n      Dick said after landing: &quot;This was the last major event of atmospheric \n      flight.&quot; Jeana added: &quot;It was a lot more difficult than we ever imagined.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      Burt Rutan\'s revolutionary plane design had worked. And, with it, Dick \n      Rutan and Jeana Yeager had joined the list of the world\'s greatest fliers.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: This Special English program was written by Marilyn Rice \n      Christiano.

Today we tell about Lady Bird Johnson. She is best known for \n      being the wife of President Lyndon Baines Johnson who led the nation \n      during the nineteen sixties. But Mrs. Johnson was also an influential \n      environmental activist, tireless campaigner and successful businesswoman.<br>\n      <br>\n      She showed great strength and heroism during a tense period in American \n      history. Her work to make America beautiful can still be seen today in \n      flowering fields, roads, and parks across the country.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Lady Bird Johnson was born Claudia Alta Taylor in \n      nineteen twelve. The Taylor family lived in the small town of Karnack, \n      Texas. Claudia’s father, Thomas Jefferson Taylor, owned two stores as well \n      as thousands of hectares for cotton production. Her mother, Minnie Taylor, \n      died when Claudia was only five years old. A woman who worked for the \n      Taylor family gave Claudia her nickname. Alice Tittle said the small child \n      was “as purty as a lady bird.”<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532959.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"113\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Lynda \n          Bird Johnson, Luci Baines Johnson, President Lyndon B.

She spent many hours by herself \n      exploring the natural beauty of the fields and forests near her home. She \n      said she grew up listening to the wind in the pine trees of the East Texas \n      woods. She said her heart found its home in the beauty, mystery, order and \n      disorder of the flowering earth.<br>\n      <br>\n      Claudia attended public schools and worked hard at her studies. But she \n      was very shy and did not like attention. When she graduated from high \n      school, she had the third highest grades in the class. She reportedly made \n      sure she finished third to avoid giving the graduation speech required by \n      the top two students in the class.<br>\n      <br>\n      SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: In nineteen thirty-four Lady Bird graduated from the \n      University of Texas in Austin with degrees in history and journalism. She \n      planned to teach or work as a theater critic. But then she met an \n      energetic congressional assistant named Lyndon Baines Johnson. The young \n      politician from Texas asked her to marry him on their first date. After \n      weeks of pressure from Mr. Johnson, Lady Bird accepted his marriage \n      proposal. Here is Mrs. Johnson talking about her first meeting with her \n      future husband:<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532960.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Claudia \n          &quot;Lady Bird&quot; Taylor in the early 1930s</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      LADY BIRD JOHNSON: “We had a \n      breakfast date, but we wound up by spending the whole day together, riding \n      and talking. Well, he really let me know before the day was over that he \n      wanted to marry me. And I thought this impossible. But on the other hand, \n      there was one thing I knew I just couldn’t bear to have happen and that \n      was to say goodbye, goodbye period.”<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: Lyndon Johnson was busy planning his political career. Within \n      three years, he ran for a seat in the United States Congress and won. Lady \n      Bird Johnson had given him ten thousand dollars to get his campaign \n      started.<br>\n      <br>\n      When Japanese planes attacked American ships at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in \n      nineteen forty-one, Mr. Johnson joined the navy to fight in World War Two. \n      Mrs. Johnson stayed in Washington, D.C. and supervised his congressional \n      office during the eight months he was away. Her excellent organizational \n      skills and smart political sense made her perfect for the job.<br>\n      <br>\n      SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: After Mr. Johnson returned, Lady Bird Johnson soon found \n      a new project. She used about seventeen thousand dollars of family money \n      to buy a small radio station in Austin, Texas. The radio station was in \n      debt and had a small broadcast range. Mrs. Johnson used her husband’s \n      connections with the Federal Communications Commission to increase the \n      radio station’s power and range.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532961.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          Her work \n          to make America beautiful can still be seen today.</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      Soon, the station started \n      making money and the company expanded into television as well. Mrs. \n      Johnson was president of the family company, LBJ Company. She traveled \n      from Washington to Austin every week to take care of business.<br>\n      <br>\n      During this time the Johnson family started to grow. Lady Bird had a \n      daughter, Lynda Bird, in nineteen forty-four. A second daughter, Luci \n      Baines, was born three years later. Lyndon Johnson’s power in politics \n      also continued to grow. In nineteen forty-eight he was elected to the \n      United States Senate.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: In nineteen sixty, John F. Kennedy ran for president of the \n      United States with Lyndon Johnson as vice president. Mrs. Kennedy was \n      unable to travel and campaign for the candidates because of her pregnancy. \n      Mrs. Johnson bravely accepted the job. She visited eleven states to help \n      express the goals of the candidates. They won the election.<br>\n      <br>\n      Mrs. Johnson was also at her husband’s side when he visited Texas with \n      President and Mrs. Kennedy on November twenty-second, nineteen \n      sixty-three.<br>\n      <br>\n      After the tragic shooting of President Kennedy in Dallas, security \n      officials led the Johnsons to the presidential plane to fly back to \n      Washington. During the flight, Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Kennedy watched as \n      Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as President of the United States.<br>\n      <br>\n      SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: In the weeks after this national tragedy Lyndon Johnson \n      worked hard to show Americans that he could be a strong president. With \n      his strong support, he got Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of \n      nineteen sixty-four. This law banned discrimination based on &quot;race, color, \n      religion, or national origin” in public places and federal programs. But \n      the law was not popular with many white voters in the southern part of the \n      country.<br>\n      <br>\n      Once again, Lady Bird Johnson came to the rescue. As part of Lyndon \n      Johnson’s nineteen sixty-four campaign for president she became a \n      spokesman for the law. Lady Bird Johnson visited important southern states \n      although Democratic governors feared for her safety. She traveled through \n      poor areas talking to angry crowds who were against her husband’s civil \n      rights policies. Lady Bird Johnson knew how to give a powerful and \n      expressive speech.<br>\n      <br>\n      She won over the loud crowds with her gentle manner and calming southern \n      accent. She told them that it was time to end the South’s racist past and \n      move into the modern world. The media later wrote that she stood as a \n      fearless moral representative of her husband. And, her work paid off. \n      Lyndon Johnson won the election.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532962.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          She said \n          her heart found its home in the beauty, mystery, order and disorder of \n          the flowering earth.</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      STEVE EMBER: The historian \n      Lewis Gould has said Mrs. Johnson and her press secretary Liz Carpenter \n      were the first to establish the job of the modern first lady. Mrs. Johnson \n      realized that the wife of the president needed to have her own team of \n      workers. She made sure she had a director of employees as well as a social \n      director. Lady Bird Johnson’s business experience and sense of \n      organization helped create a very effective system for future first ladies \n      and their causes.<br>\n      <br>\n      SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: As first lady, Mrs. Johnson became an energetic activist \n      for educational and environmental issues. She helped support Head Start, a \n      public program aimed at giving educational and health services to young \n      children from poor families.<br>\n      <br>\n      She started the Society for a More Beautiful National Capitol. Its aim was \n      to improve the beauty of Washington by planting trees and flowers in \n      public areas and parks. Mrs. Johnson understood that these improvements \n      were also linked to important issues such as pollution, public \n      transportation, mental health, and crime rates.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: But she is most well known for helping to create The \n      Beautification Act of nineteen sixty-five. It aimed to protect America’s \n      natural beauty by limiting advertising signs and cleaning up waste areas \n      on the country’s roads and highways. The law also supported the planting \n      of local flowers and trees. Here is Mrs. Johnson talking about her \n      environmental efforts:<br>\n      <br>\n      LADY BIRD JOHNSON: “Clean water, clean up the rivers, wilderness areas, \n      more national parks, all of that was a part of our aim and thrust and what \n      we tried to do. I’ve had a life long love affair with nature, a particular \n      accent on wildflowers, native plants for the whole broad face of America. \n      I hope everybody could enjoy their little piece of America as much as I \n      have enjoyed mine.”<br>\n      <br>\n      SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson had a difficult \n      four-year term. The president faced strong opposition about the United \n      States involvement in the war in Vietnam. In nineteen sixty-eight, \n      President Johnson surprised the nation by announcing that he would not \n      seek reelection as president. The Johnsons left politics and returned home \n      to Texas. Mr. Johnson died of a heart attack in nineteen seventy-three.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: Lady Bird Johnson continued her tireless work to improve the \n      country’s natural environment. She created the National Wildflower \n      Research Center in nineteen eighty-two. The center helps to educate people \n      about the environmental importance and value of native plants. Mrs. \n      Johnson died in two thousand seven at the age of ninety-four. Her memory \n      lives in the many fields of wildflowers that color the roads of America.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: This program was written and produced by Dana Demange. \n      I’m Shirley Griffith.<br>\n      <br>\n      STEVE EMBER: And I’m Steve Ember.

It was a \n      war no nation really wanted. But no nation seemed able to stop it.<br>\n      <br>\n      The assassination of Austria\'s Archduke Franz Ferdinand in the city of \n      Sarajevo was the spark that set off the explosion.<br>\n      <br>\n      This week in our series, Harry Monroe and Kay Gallant tell about the war \n      and how it affected the United States under President Woodrow Wilson.<br>\n      <br>\n      HARRY MONROE: The Austrian Archduke was murdered by Serbian nationalists. \n      They opposed Austrian control of their homeland. After the assassination, \n      Austria declared war on Serbia. One of Serbia\'s allies was Russia. Russia \n      agreed to help Serbia in any war against Austria.<br>\n      <br>\n      Austria had allies, too. The most important was Germany. Germany wanted \n      Russia to stay out of the war. When Russia refused, Germany declared war \n      on Russia. Then Germany declared war on Russia\'s close ally, France. \n      Britain entered the war a few days later when Germany violated the \n      neutrality of Belgium.<br>\n      <br>\n      KAY GALLANT: One nation after another entered the conflict to protect its \n      friends or to honor its treaties. Within a week, most of Europe was at \n      war.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532538.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"113\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          British \n          forces in action during World War One</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      On one side were the Central \n      Powers: Germany and Austria-Hungary. On the other side were the Triple \n      Entente Allies: France, Britain, and Russia. Many other nations took \n      sides. Bulgaria and Turkey joined the Central Powers. Italy, Romania, \n      Portugal, and Greece joined the Allies.<br>\n      <br>\n      HARRY MONROE: The United States hoped to stay out of the war. President \n      Wilson immediately declared American neutrality. He said: &quot;It is a war \n      with which we have nothing to do, whose causes cannot touch us.&quot;<br>\n      <br>\n      Most Americans agreed with President Wilson. They did not want to get \n      involved in the fighting. However, many found it difficult to remain \n      neutral in their hearts. Some Americans had family roots in Germany. They \n      supported the Central Powers. A greater number of Americans had family \n      roots in Britain or France. They supported the Allies.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532539.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          An \n          abandoned British trench captured by the Germans.

The United States planned to continue to trade with \n      both sides.<br>\n      <br>\n      KAY GALLANT: Germany and Austria expected a quick victory in the war. They \n      were caught between two powerful enemies: Russia and France. But German \n      military leaders were not worried. They had a battle plan they were sure \n      would succeed.<br>\n      <br>\n      The German generals planned to strike quickly at France with most of the \n      German army. They expected to defeat France in a short time and then turn \n      to fight Russia. In this way, the German army would not have to fight both \n      enemies at the same time.<br>\n      <br>\n      HARRY MONROE: At first, the plan worked. Two million German soldiers swept \n      across Belgium and into France. They rushed forward toward Paris, hoping \n      for a fast victory. But the German commanders made a mistake. They pushed \n      their men too fast. When British and French forces struck back -- outside \n      Paris -- the tired and worn German soldiers could not hold their \n      positions.<br>\n      <br>\n      The battle was fierce and unbelievably bloody. In the end, the Germans \n      were forced to withdraw.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532540.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          A 1915 \n          poster showing a French soldier holding a grenade</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      The German withdrawal gave \n      the allies time to prepare strong defenses. There was no chance now for a \n      quick German victory. Instead, it would be a long war, with Germany and \n      Austria facing enemies on two sides. Britain and France were on the West. \n      Russia was on the East.<br>\n      <br>\n      KAY GALLANT: The Allies took immediate steps to reduce Germany\'s trade \n      with the rest of the world. The British navy began seizing war supplies \n      found on neutral ships sailing toward German ports. It then expanded its \n      efforts to block food exports to Germany.<br>\n      <br>\n      The blockade by Britain and the other allies was very successful. Germany \n      faced possible starvation. Its navy was not strong enough to break the \n      blockade with surface ships. Its only hope was to break the blockade with \n      another naval weapon: submarines.<br>\n      <br>\n      Germany announced that it would use its submarines to sink any ship that \n      came near the coast of Britain. The threat included ships from neutral \n      nations that tried to continue trading with the Allies.<br>\n      <br>\n      HARRY MONROE: The United States and other neutral nations immediately \n      protested the German announcement. They said it was a clear violation of \n      international law.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532541.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          A German \n          submarine said to be the one that sank the Lusitania</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      When a German submarine sank \n      a British ship in the Irish Sea, one of the victims was an American \n      citizen. A few weeks later, an American oil ship was damaged during a sea \n      battle between British navy ships and a German submarine. Then came the \n      most serious incident of all. It involved a British passenger ship called \n      the Lusitania.<br>\n      <br>\n      The Lusitania was sailing from New York City to Britain when it was \n      attacked by a German submarine. The Lusitania sank in eighteen minutes. \n      One thousand two hundred persons were killed. One hundred twenty-nine were \n      Americans.<br>\n      <br>\n      KAY GALLANT: The sinking of the Lusitania shocked and horrified the \n      American people. They called it mass murder. They turned against Germany. \n      President Wilson warned that he might declare war on Germany, if Germany \n      continued to sink civilian ships.<br>\n      <br>\n      Germany did not want war with the United States. It already faced a strong \n      fight against the European Allies. It promised not to sink any more \n      civilian ships without warning. And it offered regrets for the Lusitania \n      incident.<br>\n      <br>\n      HARRY MONROE: President Wilson accepted Germany\'s apology. Like most \n      Americans, he hoped to stay out of the bloody European struggle. And he \n      also knew that the record of the Allies was not completely clean.<br>\n      <br>\n      For example, he was troubled by reports of mass hunger in Germany. He and \n      other Americans felt the British food blockade was cruel. They also were \n      shocked by the way British forces brutally crushed a rebellion in Ireland \n      at the time.<br>\n      <br>\n      Most of all, the American people were sickened by reports of what was \n      happening on the battlefields of Europe. The armies were using poison gas \n      and other terrible weapons. Soldiers on both sides were dying by the \n      millions. The war had become a bloodbath.<br>\n　\n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          <img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.guluwang.com/guluimage/2010101013532542.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"></td>\n        \n        \n          <td width=\"100%\">\n          \n          President Woodrow Wilson in 1916</td>\n        \n      \n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\">\n      KAY GALLANT: The United \n      States had a presidential election in nineteen sixteen. President Wilson \n      won the nomination of the Democratic Party to seek re-election. Democrats \n      around the country shouted their support with these words: &quot;He kept us out \n      of war!&quot; Wilson himself did not like the words. He felt it raised false \n      hopes. But people continued to say it, because they did not want war.<br>\n      <br>\n      HARRY MONROE: The Republican Party nominated Supreme Court Justice Charles \n      Evans Hughes as its candidate for president. Hughes was a moderate \n      Republican. He supported a number of social reforms.<br>\n      <br>\n      Like Wilson, Hughes promised to keep the United States neutral. However, \n      one of his supporters was former President Theodore Roosevelt. And \n      Roosevelt called for strong American policies that could lead to war. \n      Roosevelt\'s words led many Americans to see Wilson as the candidate of \n      peace....and Hughes as the candidate of war.<br>\n      <br>\n      KAY GALLANT: Voting in the presidential election was very close. At first, \n      it seemed Hughes had won. He went to bed on election night believing he \n      would be America\'s next president. But voting results later that night \n      confirmed Wilson as the winner. The election was so close the Republicans \n      did not accept defeat for two weeks.<br>\n      <br>\n      Woodrow Wilson had won another term. During that term, he would find it \n      increasingly difficult to honor the words of the campaign. Finally, he \n      would find it impossible. The United States entered World War One while \n      Woodrow Wilson was president.<br>\n      <br>\n      That will be our story next week.<br>\n      <br>\n      (MUSIC)<br>\n      <br>\n      BOB DOUGHTY: Our program was written by Frank Beardsley.

Not so much of dying, but certainly of getting sick with complications that can require a hospital stay.</p>\r\n<p>Only a few countries currently vaccinate young children against the flu. The United States is one. Another is Finland, where Dr. Terho Heikkinen of the University of Turku led this new study.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;The problem has been that there has been no clear data on the efficacy of the vaccine in the youngest children,&quot; says Heikkinen. &quot;And therefore, many countries, although they think that influenza is an important illness in young children, they have been reluctant in moving forward in vaccination until some convincing data are available.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Heikkinen and his colleagues set out to provide that convincing data.</p>\r\n<p>Children in their study ranged from nine months to just over three years old. As a whole, those who were vaccinated were less likely to get the flu. That was especially true among the youngest, those under age two. In that group, 12 percent of those who did not get a vaccination came down with flu, but only four percent who were fully vaccinated got the disease.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;This is the first study that clearly shows that the inactivated vaccine that\'s available for young children these days is clearly effective, even in the age group younger than two years,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>The results of vaccination are actually better than those numbers suggest. In the 2007-2008 flu season, when this study was conducted, the vaccine was designed to protect against two varieties of the flu, but it turned out to be largely ineffective against type B. Against type A influenza, 10 percent of the unvaccinated under-twos got sick, but only two percent of those who were fully vaccinated got the flu.</p>\r\n<p>Heikkinen does not say that young children should start getting flu shots. But he said his study - and one other study that examined the issue a few years ago - both concluded that flu vaccines can be effective and safe for this age group, so policy makers, doctors, and parents ought to at least think about it.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;I believe that the vaccine recommendations of young children will be at least reconsidered in all countries that do not vaccinate at this time.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Terho Heikkinen\'s study is published online by the journal, The Lancet Infectious Diseases.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>','http://f1.hxen.com/m2/standard/2010/11/20101127h.mp3');

The extracts come from a quarter of a million documents passing between the State Department in Washington and the US diplomatic missions over the past three years. Among the revelations, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states have been urging the US to halt Iran\'s nuclear programme by any means including military force. Here is our diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus.</font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">This avalanche of cables from the internal supposedly secure email switching system linking US embassies abroad with the State Department and Pentagon in Washington is a nightmare for US diplomacy. A White House statement noted in response that by its very nature, field reporting to Washington is candid and often incomplete information. It is not an expression of policy, the statement goes on, nor does it always shape final policy decisions. Now this may all be true. But world leaders do not expect to have their private conversations with the US officials or candid assessments of their capabilities and peculiarities publicised for all to see. </font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">The White House has described the publication of the diplomatic cables as reckless and dangerous.<br />\r\nBoth Democrats and Republicans condemned the release of the classified material. The Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said those responsible should face justice. </font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">&quot;The people at Wikileaks could have blood on their hands. We are at risk here from Iran, North Korea and other actors. We\'re at war. I mean the world is getting dangerous by the day. And people who do this are low on the food chain as far as I\'m concerned. If you can prosecute them, let\'s try.&quot;</font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">Twelve of the 18 candidates running in the presidential election that\'s currently underway in Haiti have called for the vote to be cancelled.

One by one, the opposition leaders came in accompanied by their supporters. Huge cheers, chants and the singing of the national anthem took place even before the joint declaration was read out. The declaration called for the immediate annulment of these elections because of what the loose coalition of opposition candidates called the rigging and fraud perpetrated by the incumbent President Rene Preval and the man he wants to be his successor Jude Celestin. The declaration also called on all of the men and women of Haiti to mobilise in peaceful protest against the elections. </font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">Police in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro said they\'re now in control of one of the city\'s most violent areas.

The deal, worth around $113bn, was finalised at an emergency meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels. The ministers said the agreement would help safeguard financial stability across the euro-zone. The Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said the interest rate on the loans would be at an average of just under 6%.</font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">&quot;These loans will provide money that we had already planned to borrow on the international markets. That funding will now be available to Ireland at a cheaper interest rate than if we borrowed on those markets. Without these loans, the necessary tax increases and spending cuts would be far more severe and they would be imposed far more quickly than as proposed in the government\'s national recovery plan.&quot;</font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">Voters in Switzerland have backed a proposal for the automatic expulsion of non-Swiss citizens for certain crimes.

The country\'s last major outbreak of the disease was more than one hundred years ago.</p>\r\n<p>Disease-control experts from the United States confirmed the first cases of cholera in Haiti on October twenty-first in the Artibonite area.

The commission&rsquo;s co-chairman, William Reilly, said the three companies, BP, Transocean and Halliburton, shared a culture of complacency rather than safety. It was the final day of hearings before the panel reports back in January. Paul Adam is in Washington.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWilliam Reilly didn&rsquo;t miss his words. The three companies were, he said, in need of top-to-bottom reform. The accident in April had been caused by what he described as &ldquo;a sweep of bad decisions&rdquo;, with the companies apparently rushing to complete the well. Meanwhile, the former BP Chief Executive Tony Haywood has told the BBC that his company was unprepared for the oil spill and has made up its response day by day. Mr Haywood, who stepped down as CEO in October, said he resented his treatment of the hands of a hostile US media and said he might have done a public relations job if he studied acting, not geology. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cholera epidemic in Haiti has been declared a matter of national security after it spread to the capital Port-au-Prince. The Health Ministry gave details to the first case in the city. Greg Morsbach reports.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA three-year-old boy from a poor shantytown is the first cholera patient in the capital. Apparently he&rsquo;d not had any contact with people living in the countryside where the disease was first reported. That suggests that a new cluster of cases may now emerge in the capital. The authorities are taking no risks and are testing more than 100 people in Port-au-Prince who showed some symptoms of the disease. The Health Ministry fears that if cholera gets a foot-out in the capital, the urban slums are likely to be hardest hit. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe European Commission has fined 11 airlines more than $1billion dollars between them for fixing air cargo prices. The carriers include British Airways, Air France and Japan Airlines.

The airlines were accused of running a price-fixing cartel involving illegal collusion on air freight charges. Air France must pay the single largest penalty with British Airways also fined more than $100million. The German carrier Lufthansa has not been fined as it provided the information that led to the investigation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUS defence officials say they&rsquo;ve been unable so far to explain the setting of an apparent missile vapour trail off the coast of California on Monday.

They are the ones who need relief right now.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSo something&rsquo;s got to be done.&nbsp; And I believe there&rsquo;s room for us to compromise and get it done together.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s start where we agree.&nbsp; All of us want certainty for middle-class Americans.&nbsp; None of us want them to wake up on January 1st with a higher tax bill.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I believe we should permanently extend the Bush tax cuts for all families making less than $250,000 a year.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s 98 percent of the American people. &nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe also agree on the need to start cutting spending and bringing down our deficit.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s going to require everyone to make some tough choices.&nbsp; In fact, if Congress were to implement my proposal to freeze non-security discretionary spending for three years, it would bring this spending down to its lowest level as share of the economy in 50 years.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBut at a time when we are going to ask folks across the board to make such difficult sacrifices, I don&rsquo;t see how we can afford to borrow an additional $700 billion from other countries to make all the Bush tax cuts permanent, even for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d be digging ourselves into an even deeper fiscal hole and passing the burden on to our children.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nI recognize that both parties are going to have to work together and compromise to get something done here.&nbsp; But I want to make my priorities clear from the start.&nbsp; One: middle class families need permanent tax relief. And two: I believe we can&rsquo;t afford to borrow and spend another $700 billion on permanent tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThere are new public servants in Washington, but we still face the same challenges.&nbsp; And you made it clear that it&rsquo;s time for results.

The panel also said it was investigating suspicious activity by a sanctioned North Korean firm in Burma and the arrest of three individuals in Japan. They were allegedly trying to export technology that could be used to make a component of a nuclear centrifuge. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRwanda is planning to circumcise two million men over the next two years in a major initiative to tackle AIDS. Rwanda has a three-percent HIV infection rate. David Banfer reports.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWork on the project began in 2008 after studies indicated that circumcised males are 60% more likely to be protected against HIV during sexual intercourse. Before now, male circumcision has not been a common tradition in Rwanda, so persuading men to volunteer involves setting an extensive information campaign. Health workers have been trained for the procedure. The program is first targeting in particular soldiers and police, for whom circumcision is likely to be obligatory rather than a request, as well as university students. The health authorities are also campaigning for all male infants to be circumcised. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe European Union says it&rsquo;s agreed to hold talks with Iran over its controversial nuclear program on 5 December.

Our correspondent Adam Mynott was at the scene.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was a moment of delirious excitement for thousands who&rsquo;ve rushed to Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s home as word rippled through Rangoon that she was to be released. The diminutive 65-year-old democracy campaigner climbed up steps behind the gate of her compound and the crowd went mad with joy. For 20 minutes she tried in vain to quieten her delirious followers, and she spoke in measured tones. I will have more to say tomorrow, she says, but unity can only come when we work together to achieve our goals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Many in the crowd held up cameras and mobile phones to record Aung San Suu Kyi speak.

She won the last free elections in Burma in 1990 but has never been allowed to govern. But just how free she&rsquo;ll be to lead her political party is not yet clear, as John Simpson reports from Burma.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat we saw here today were scenes of extraordinary unforgettable pleasure, but no one knows what comes next. Aung San Suu Kyi phrased her new policy with deliberate vagueness when she talked about people working together to achieve their goals. Working with the opposition leaders who felt she was wrong to opt out of last week&rsquo;s elections-certainly, but working with the generals who&rsquo;ve run this country and have kept her prisoner so long-that&rsquo;s going to be very hard indeed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and called on the Burmese military government to set free all its political prisoners. President Obama said Aung San Suu Kyi was one of his heroes. The British prime minister, David Cameron, said she was an inspiration for all who believe in freedom of speech, democracy and human rights. The head of the Asian regional grouping ASEAN, Surin Pitsuwan, said he was very very relieved that Ms Suu Kyi had been released.

The company had been criticized in the US for failing to apologize. Hugh Schofield reports.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrench state-owned trains and state-paid rail workers were responsible for carrying some 76,000 Jews from France to Germany on the east in World War II. Only a few of them returned. Ever since, SNCF has insisted that it was not responsible. The rail operator was requisition by the German occupier and workers had no choice but to obey, it said. But now on a trip to the United States, the rail company&rsquo;s chief executive Guillaume Pepy has said that SNCF expressed its profound sorrow and regret for the consequences of its actions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Iraqi parliament has approved a power-sharing agreement between the main political blocs, paving the way for what&rsquo;s been described as &ldquo;a government of national partnership&rdquo;.

The economic battle for these markets is fierce, and we&rsquo;re up against strong competitors. But as I&rsquo;ve said many times, America doesn&rsquo;t play for second place. The future we&rsquo;re fighting for isn&rsquo;t as the world&rsquo;s largest importer, consuming products made elsewhere, but as the world&rsquo;s largest manufacturer of ideas and goods sold around the world.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOpening new markets will not only help America&rsquo;s businesses create new jobs for American workers. It will also help us reduce our deficits &ndash; because the single greatest tool for getting our fiscal house in order is robust economic growth. That kind of growth will require ensuring that our students are getting the best education possible; that we&rsquo;re on the cutting edge of research and development; and that we&rsquo;re rebuilding our roads and railways, runways and ports &ndash; so our infrastructure is up to the challenges of the 21st century.&nbsp; <br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nGiven the deficits that have mounted up over the past decade, we can&rsquo;t afford to make these investments unless we&rsquo;re also willing to cut what we don&rsquo;t need. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve submitted to Congress a plan for a three-year budget freeze, and I&rsquo;m prepared to offer additional savings.&nbsp; But as we work to reform our budget, Congress should also put some skin in the game. I agree with those Republican and Democratic members of Congress who&rsquo;ve recently said that in these challenging days, we can&rsquo;t afford what are called earmarks. These are items inserted into spending bills by members of Congress without adequate review.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nNow, some of these earmarks support worthy projects in our local communities. But many others do not. We can&rsquo;t afford Bridges to Nowhere like the one that was planned a few years back in Alaska. Earmarks like these represent a relatively small part of overall federal spending. But when it comes to signaling our commitment to fiscal <span class=\"vocabulary\" sizcache=\"0\" sizset=\"1\"><span class=\"searchkey\" jquery1289829353234=\"5\">responsibility</span></span>, addressing them would have an important impact.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs a Senator, I helped <span class=\"vocabulary\" sizcache=\"0\" sizset=\"2\"><span class=\"searchkey\" jquery1289829353234=\"6\">eliminate</span></span> anonymous earmarks and created new measures of transparency so Americans can better follow how their tax dollars are being spent. As President, time and again, I&rsquo;ve called for new limitations on earmarks. We&rsquo;ve reduced the cost of earmarks by over $3 billion. And we&rsquo;ve put in place higher standards of transparency by putting as much information as possible on earmarks.gov. In fact, this week, we updated the site with more information about where last year&rsquo;s earmarks were actually spent, and made it easier to look up Members of Congress and the earmarks they fought for.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nToday, we have a chance to go further. We have a chance to not only shine a light on a bad Washington habit that wastes billions of taxpayer dollars, but take a step towards restoring public trust. We have a chance to advance the interests not of Republicans or <span class=\"vocabulary\" sizcache=\"0\" sizset=\"3\"><span class=\"searchkey\" jquery1289829353234=\"7\">Democrats</span></span>, but of the American people; to put our country on the path of fiscal <span class=\"vocabulary\" sizcache=\"0\" sizset=\"4\"><span class=\"searchkey\" jquery1289829353234=\"8\">discipline</span></span> and <span class=\"vocabulary\" sizcache=\"0\" sizset=\"5\"><span class=\"searchkey\" jquery1289829353234=\"9\">responsibility</span></span> that will lead to a brighter economic future for all.

The Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said the request had been accepted by Ireland&rsquo;s partners in the European Union. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Above all I want to assure the Irish people that we have a better future before us so that we can teach and act together in the national interest now and confirm that the government has today decided that Ireland apply at foreign financial assistance at the European Union. The request of the government was transmitted to European authorities this evening. European authorities have agreed to our request.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith more details on the rescue package, here is Jonty Bloom in Brussels. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe deal which was agreed during a conference call of European finance ministers tonight will include a loan of around 18 billion euros over three years. It&rsquo;s become necessary as a continuing recession in Ireland and the almost total collapse in Ireland&rsquo;s banking industry meant that confidence in the country&rsquo;s economic future had been fatally undermined. The money will be used to help fill a massive shortfall in government revenue and to restructure Ireland&rsquo;s banks. But the full details are not yet known and will be negotiated in coming days. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Vatican has played down the importance of remarks by Pope Benedict, appearing to temper the opposition of the Roman Catholic Church to the use of condoms. The pope has suggested in a Vatican newspaper that the use of condoms could sometimes be justified, for example, when used by a prostitute to prevent the spread of AIDS. David Willey reports from Rome.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpeaking on Vatican Radio, Federico Lombardi, who&rsquo;s the head of Vatican radio and television as well as holding the official post of people&rsquo;s spokesperson, minimized the importance of the pope&rsquo;s remarks on condoms and prostitutes. He said the pope&rsquo;s words marked no revolution in Catholic teaching. But Federico Lombardi emphasized that Pope Benedict had never before referred to the use of condoms in a colloquial way rather than in his role as a teacher of church doctrine. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA senior official in the Obama administration says North Korea&rsquo;s latest disclosures about its nuclear programme are a further provocative act of defiance. The official said the North Korean claim to have built a new uranium enrichment plant was a breach of its own pledges and commitments. An American scientist has just said the North Koreans had shown him hundreds of centrifuges that they claimed were enriching uranium for nuclear power. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main opposition group in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, says more than 1,200 of its members, including eight parliamentary candidates, have been detained in the run-up two elections next week. Supporters of the group, which is outlawed in Egypt, clashed with security forces in several cities over the past few days. The government says the Brotherhood is breaking the law by using religious slogans. Despite being banned, Muslim Brotherhood members have been elected to parliament as independent candidates and it controls about a fifth of the seats. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorld News from the BBC<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross says the Sri Lankan government has asked to scale down its work in the former war zone in the north of the country. The ICRC told the BBC it would keep operations in the capital Colombo, but not in Jaffna and Vavuniya, which were strongholds of the rebel Tamil Tigers until their defeat last year. Caroline Locker reports. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka that killed 70,000 people and injured many more, the ICRC has been supporting victims in the worst-affected areas in the north of the country. In Jaffna, for example, it runs an orthopaedic centre that provides artificial limbs to about 2,000 amputees. But the head of the ICRC in&nbsp;Srilanka Ive Johnanoni says the authorities have asked that some of these activities be stopped. The government hasn&rsquo;t yet given a reason, but the move is likely to feel criticism that it&rsquo;s turning a blind eye to reported human rights abuses. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nState media in China say a man has been rescued after spending three days trapped in a narrow pipe beneath the sea. The man had been working in the tube on an offshore platform. Reports said tidal pressure had suddenly crushed the pipe, trapping him inside. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn exhibition has opened in Germany to mark the 65th anniversary of the beginning of the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals at the end of World War II. Over the following three years, a number of lesser trials were held. The chief attorney at the follow-up trials, Benjamin Ferencz, said the memorial showed that Germany had come to terms with its history. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;My biggest regret was that I never heard from any German saying &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rsquo;. The absence of remorse even on the part of the defendants who were mass murderers was very disappointing to me. And I would never have believed that I would come back 65 years later and hear a completely different voice and a different plan in the same country.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBBC News</p>','http://enedu.putclub.com/update/sest/201011/22/putclub.com_20101122BBC.mp3');

The idea is simple &ndash; as the two nations with over 90 percent of the world&rsquo;s nuclear weapons, the United States and Russia have a responsibility to work together to reduce our arsenals. And to ensure that our national security is protected, the United States has an interest in tracking Russia&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal through a verification effort that puts U.S. inspectors on the ground. As President Reagan said when he signed a nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union in 1987, &ldquo;Trust, but verify.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>That is precisely what the New START Treaty does. After nearly a full year of negotiations, we completed an agreement earlier this year that cuts by a third the number of long-range nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles that the United States and Russia can deploy, while ensuring that America retains a strong nuclear deterrent, and can put inspectors back on the ground in Russia.</p>\r\n<p>The Treaty also helped us reset our relations with Russia, which led to concrete benefits. For instance, Russia has been indispensable to our efforts to enforce strong sanctions on Iran, to secure loose nuclear material from terrorists, and to equip our troops in Afghanistan.</p>\r\n<p>All of this will be put to risk if the Senate does not pass the New START Treaty.</p>\r\n<p>Without ratification this year, the United States will have no inspectors on the ground, and no ability to verify Russian nuclear activities. So those who would block this treaty are breaking President Reagan&rsquo;s rule &ndash; they want to trust, but not verify.</p>\r\n<p>Without ratification, we put at risk the coalition that we have built to put pressure on Iran, and the transit route through Russia that we use to equip our troops in Afghanistan. And without ratification, we risk undoing decades of American leadership on nuclear security, and decades of bipartisanship on this issue. Our security and our position in the world are at stake.</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, since the Reagan years, every President has pursued a negotiated, verified, arms reduction treaty. And every time that these treaties have been reviewed by the Senate, they have passed with over 85 votes. Bipartisan support for New START could not be stronger. It has been endorsed by Republicans from the Reagan Administration and both Bush Administrations &ndash; including Colin Powell, George Shultz, Jim Baker, and Henry Kissinger. And it was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by a strong bipartisan vote of 14-4.</p>\r\n<p>Over the last several months, several questions have been asked about New START, and we have answered every single one. Some have asked whether it will limit our missile defense &ndash; it will not. Some, including Senator Jon Kyl, have asked that we modernize our nuclear infrastructure for the 21st century &ndash; we are doing so, and plan to invest at least $85 billion in that effort over the next ten years &ndash; a significant increase from the Bush Administration.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, some make no argument against the Treaty &ndash; they just ask for more time. But remember this: it has already been 11 months since we&rsquo;ve had inspectors in Russia, and every day that goes by without ratification is a day that we lose confidence in our understanding of Russia&rsquo;s nuclear weapons. If the Senate doesn&rsquo;t act this year &ndash; after six months, 18 hearings, and nearly a thousand questions answered &ndash; it would have to start over from scratch in January.</p>\r\n<p>The choice is clear: a failure to ratify New START would be a dangerous gamble with America&rsquo;s national security, setting back our understanding of Russia&rsquo;s nuclear weapons, as well as our leadership in the world. That is not what the American people sent us to Washington to do.</p>\r\n<p>There is enough gridlock, enough bickering. If there is one issue that should unite us &ndash; as Republicans and Democrats &ndash; it should be our national security.</p>\r\n<p>Some things are bigger than politics. As Republican Dick Lugar said the other day, &ldquo;Every Senator has an obligation in the national security interest to take a stand, to do his or her duty.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Senator Lugar is right. And if the Senate passes this treaty, it will not be an achievement for Democrats or Republicans &ndash; it will be a win for America.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>','http://down02.putclub.com/virtual/backup/update/bush/putclub.com_2010obm1120.mp3');

The images are life-size yet not truly lifelike. They lack the depth that people would normally see if they were in the same room together. But this could change in the future with new kinds of three-dimensional telepresence systems.</p>\r\n<p>Last week, we told you about a 3-D system at the University of Arizona. Researchers can send a moving image over the Internet and show it on a special screen in close to real time. People would not have to wear special glasses like they often need to watch 3-D movies.</p>\r\n<p>The system uses a lot of cameras to take pictures of a person from different positions. Lasers reproduce the pictures combined into three-dimensional images, or holograms. The image appears more realistic with the more cameras that are used and the more pictures that are taken.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHoward Lichtman is president of the Human Productivity Lab. His company advises other companies on buying and using telepresence systems. Mr. Lichtman also publishes Telepresence Options, which reports on the industry.</p>\r\n<p>He says this latest development would have done wonders for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie with the famous &quot;Princess Leia&quot; hologram scene.</p>\r\n<p>HOWARD LICHTMAN: &quot;For Princess Leia to talk, Princess Leia needs to move and her mouth needs to move, etc.&nbsp; And you haven\'t been able to do that with a regular hologram because the hologram would only be fixed in one spot. What they\'re able to do is, they\'re able to refresh that image so that the image changes the same way a person changes when they talk.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>The researchers in Arizona say their 3-D system is still years away from completion. Even then, Howard Lichtman says it may have trouble competing with systems already on the market.</p>\r\n<p>Most telepresence systems are two-dimensional. But Mr. Lichtman says the images are very realistic.</p>\r\n<p>HOWARD LICHTMAN: &quot;It\'s a 2-D image, but it\'s crystal clear, photo realistic, fluid movement, accurate flesh tones, and you would swear you were in the same physical space with people who might be thousands of miles away.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>He says prices for telepresence systems are going down as more people use the technology.</p>\r\n<p>HOWARD LICHTMAN: &quot;It\'s pushing down to everybody as these environments are becoming publicly available or you can rent them by the hour, and at the same time that you\'re getting very high quality, high definition video conferencing showing up on mobile devices and in the home delivered through the set-top box or through the PC.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>A new eighteen-million-dollar project aims to create eleven telepresence centers for federal employees around the United States. The government is working with the AT&amp;T company to save money and reduce pollution by reducing the need for travel.</p>\r\n<p>And that\'s the VOA Special English Technology Report, written by June Simms.</p>','http://s5.hxen.com/m2/voa/2010/11/20101122b.mp3');

I\'m Shirley Griffith.</p>\r\n<p>STEVE EMBER: And I\'m Steve Ember.&nbsp; This week on our program, we look at how some Americans are dealing with the current economic situation.</p>\r\n<p>(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSHIRLEY GRIFFITH: &quot;Reality&quot; television shows are very popular in America. Some show the lives of the wealthiest people in the country.&nbsp; &quot;How\'d You Get So Rich?&quot; is one program on cable television. The program features people worth more than a million dollars. It&nbsp; shows how they got their money and what they do with it.</p>\r\n<p>The interest in wealthy people may have something to do with the increasing difference between the richest and poorest Americans.</p>\r\n<p>STEVE EMBER: Recent Census Bureau findings show the number of Americans in poverty is the highest in more than fifty years. In addition, the income inequality between rich and poor Americans has been increasing in recent years. It reached the greatest difference ever last year.&nbsp; And the United States has the greatest income inequality among industrial nations.</p>\r\n<p>Economists say the recession and the high unemployment rate are among the reasons for the growing number of poor Americans. Henry Freedman is director of the non-governmental National Center for Law and Economic Justice. He says the decrease in the number of people in the middle class has also had an effect.</p>\r\n<p>HENRY FREEDMAN:&quot;The elimination of most of those jobs that people could get in factories, our factories are not there so much anymore. Other kinds of clerical work that is either being outsourced or is being replaced by technology that does it efficiently. Those people are competing with people below them for work.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Robert Hawkins is associate professor of social work at New York University. He says people in poor areas do not have the same chances for success that rich people have.</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT HAWKINS:&quot;What we have there are people who did not and do not have opportunities. So those folks cannot get an education, and so, what happens? They cannot get a job.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Professor Hawkins says lack of opportunities causes greater risk for crime, teenage pregnancy, illness and early death. He also says the weakening of the middle class could have lasting effects on everyone.</p>\r\n<p>He says it could affect the quality of teachers, law enforcement officers and nurses. The professor says wealthy people have increasing political influence in America because the poor are not using it.</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT HAWKINS: &quot;If low-income people want more political power, they have got to organize, they have got to vote. That is the best and probably only way.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\nWith Soup Swap, home cooks trade soups to add variety to their dinners<br />\r\nSTEVE EMBER: Almost ten percent of Americans are unemployed.&nbsp; Some people believe one way to deal with a bad situation is to laugh at it. That is the idea behind &quot;The Adventures of Unemployed Man.&quot;&nbsp; It is a funny version of the superhero comic books. Writers Erich Origen and Gan Golan created the comic book.</p>\r\n<p>The story is about a man called Ultimatum. He teaches the power of positive thinking: If you can believe it, you can do it.&nbsp; That is, until he meets a woman searching for food in the trash. She explains that she has a job and works hard.&nbsp; But she is still paid too little and has to find food to survive. When Ultimatum tries to help her, he is fired from his job and becomes Unemployed Man.&nbsp; He cannot find a job. Erich Origen explains:</p>\r\n<p>ERICH ORIGEN:&quot;Unemployed Man lost his house in a fantastic foreclosure. He\'s living in a cave, Rock Bottom, which is the cave underneath his former mansion.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Unemployed Man searches for work. He fights against bad people or super villains with the help of other down-on-their-luck superheroes.&nbsp; Will Unemployed Man find a job? Will he be defeated by evil forces like The Human Resource and Toxic Debt Blob? &quot;The Adventures of Unemployed Man&quot; is a light-hearted story of the recession and unemployment.</p>\r\n<p>Erich Origen says that early in &quot;The Adventures of Unemployed Man,&quot; our hero meets his silver-haired friend, Plan B.&nbsp; He cannot get hired because he is too old.</p>\r\n<p>ERICH ORIGEN: &quot;They met in a job line and of course Plan B has been in the business for decades and can\'t afford to go into retirement because the broker made a joke with his 401K.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>STEVE EMBER: The writers had fun with the names of their characters, using terms from financial news. Gan Golan says Unemployed Man and Plan B meet others who are affected by the economic crisis. They include Wonder Mother and Fantasma, an undocumented immigrant superhero.</p>\r\n<p>The superheroes struggle with the economic crisis and a group of evildoers who are profiting from it, including Outsource. Here Erich Origen reads an exchange between the bad guys and one of the heroes:</p>\r\n<p>ERICH ORIGEN: &quot;His ideas infect others, eliminate him immediately! Then backdate a charge on his credit card and raise his APR by seventy percent!</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Pain! It\'s time you got &hellip; the boot! Klank! You\'re fired!</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Aaaah!&quot;</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: The classic American superheroes, like Superman and Batman, first appeared in the late nineteen thirties. During the time of the Great Depression, they were symbols of hope and the desire to succeed.</p>\r\n<p>Erich Origen says the idea for unemployed superheroes came from the present economic downturn.&nbsp; But unlike Superman and Wonder Woman, Unemployed Man\'s friends have no superpowers other than the ability to face reality. Gan Golan and Erich Origen want people to laugh as they deal with their troubles.</p>\r\n<p>GAN GOLAN:&quot;A depression is not just an economic term, it\'s an emotional term. And I think we\'re providing a kind of comedic stimulus package for the country and for other people who are struggling right now.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>STEVE EMBER: Many Americans save money by preparing nutritious soups to feed themselves and their families. These soups usually include more vegetables than meat and go a long way.&nbsp; People often make these soups in large amounts.</p>\r\n<p>A few years ago, Knox Gardner, a technology consultant in Seattle, Washington, made a big pot of soup. He grew tired of eating it day after day. So he decided to get a few friends together for a soup trade.</p>\r\n<p>KNOX GARDNER:&quot;My original idea was that it would be some loud, boisterous kind of event, where you would trade three of my corn chowders, because you know I\'m an awesome cook, for, you know, one of your minestrones.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>This was the beginning of Soup Swap. It works like this:</p>\r\n<p>KNOX GARDNER: &quot;You bring six quarts, (liters) and then draw numbers and go around the room six times until everybody gets all new soups.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to a set of rules, Knox Gardner got a website and declared National Soup Swap Day in January. The idea has spread across the country. There are now soup swaps from New York to Texas.</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: In Portland, Oregon, Jon Van Oast and Megan Kelley invited twelve friends to a Soup Swap.&nbsp; People started by sharing their stories about how they made their soup.&nbsp; Knox Gardner calls this &quot;The Telling of the Soup.&quot;&nbsp; Some recipes came from the Internet. Others, like Christina Kellogg-Gratschner\'s fruit soup, were family traditions.</p>\r\n<p>CHRISTINA KELLOGG-GRATSCHNER: &quot;Fruit soup is something that my mom would make out of all her home canning pears, peaches, whatever she happened to have. And she\'d cook it up with a little bit of cornstarch, and pour it on whole wheat toast.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Swappers then went around the circle, choosing their six quarts or liters.&nbsp; People were excited about leaving with a collection of different soups, especially people with busy lives. Stacy Meyer teaches fifth grade and tries to fit inexpensive and healthful meals into her diet.</p>\r\n<p>STACY MEYER: &quot;I will admit to having the breakfast-for-dinner kind of thing, that\'s happened before. And so being able to have a ready-made dinner in the freezer helps out quite a bit.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>STEVE EMBER: Boston University economist Juliet Schor says people are increasingly coming together for these kinds of informal swaps. In her latest book, &quot;Plenitude,&quot; she describes how the economic downturn has made more people open to the idea of swapping. And the Internet has made it easier.</p>\r\n<p>JULIET SCHOR: &quot;In the past, if you wanted to organize some kind of a neighborhood swap or sharing scheme, you\'d have to go around and call the people in the neighborhood, knock on their doors, etc. So there\'s a lot of what economists call transactions costs. With the Internet, that\'s drastically reduced.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Ms. Schor says that once these swaps come together, they strengthen connections between people. This is what economists and sociologists call &quot;social capital.&quot; Juliet Schor says communities with strong social ties work better.</p>\r\n<p>JULIET SCHOR: &quot;Soup may seem like a small thing, but it may turn out that your sharing network is very important to you if you lose your job, if your housing is in jeopardy. You\'re going to have these folks to rely on.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Soup Swap activity has increased every year, as more groups start up. Founder Knox Gardner agrees that the Internet and the economy have helped its popularity. But, he says, it is also because of the soup.</p>\r\n<p>KNOX GARDNER:&quot;I think that there\'s something really fundamental that happens when people bring food together to share it.

It was the time of the big Depression. The song had meaning for many people who had lost their jobs.</p>\r\n<p>A dime is a piece of money whose value is one-tenth of a dollar. Today, a dime does not buy much. But it was different in the nineteen thirties. A dime sometimes meant the difference between eating and starving.</p>\r\n<p>The American economy today is much better. Yet, many workers are concerned about losing their jobs as companies re-organize.</p>\r\n<p>Americans have special ways of talking about economic troubles. People in businesses may say they feel the pinch. Or they may say they are up against it. Or, if things are really bad, they may say they have to throw in the towel.</p>\r\n<p>A pinch is painful pressure. To feel the pinch is to suffer painful pressure involving money.</p>\r\n<p>The expression, feel the pinch, has been used since the sixteenth century. The famous English writer William Shakespeare wrote something very close to this in his great play &quot;King Lear.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>King Lear says he would accept necessity\'s sharp pinch. He means he would have to do without many of the things he always had.</p>\r\n<p>Much later, the Times of London newspaper used the expression about bad economic times during the eighteen sixties. It said, &quot;so much money having been spent ... All classes felt the pinch.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Worse than feeling the pinch is being up against it. The saying means to be in a lot of trouble.</p>\r\n<p>Word expert James Rogers says the word &quot;it&quot; in the saying can mean any and all difficulties. He says the saying became popular in the United States and Canada in the late nineteenth century. Writer George Ade used it in a book called &quot;Artie.&quot; He wrote, &quot;I saw I was up against it.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes a business that is up against it will have to throw in the towel. This means to accept defeat or surrender.</p>\r\n<p>Throwing in the towel may mean that a company will have to declare bankruptcy. The company will have to take legal steps to let people know it has no money to pay its debts.</p>\r\n<p>Word expert Charles Funk says an eighteen seventy-four publication called the Slang Dictionary explains throwing in the towel. It says the words probably came from the sport of boxing, or prizefighting. The book says the saying began because a competitor\'s face was cleaned with a cloth towel or other material. When a boxer\'s towel was thrown, it meant he was admitting defeat.</p>\r\n<p>Most businesses do not throw in the towel. They just re-organize so they can compete better.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>','http://www.hxen.com/englishlistening/voaenglish/voaspecialenglish/2010-11-21/127751.html');

Every week we tell about someone important in the history of the United States. Today we tell about writer F. Scott Fitzgerald.</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Early in nineteen twenty, the American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald was poor and unknown. He was twenty-four years old. The girl he wanted to marry had rejected him. Her family said he could not support her.</p>\r\n<p>Later that same year, Fitzgerald\'s first novel, &ldquo;This Side of Paradise,&rdquo; was accepted for publication. He said that when the news arrived in the mail: &quot;I left my job. I paid my debts, bought a suit of clothes and woke in the morning to a world of promise.&quot;</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe quickly became rich and famous. That year before &ldquo;This Side of Paradise&rdquo; was published, he said he earned eight hundred dollars by writing. The following year, with his first book published, he earned eighteen thousand dollars by writing.</p>\r\n<p>Yet by the time F. Scott Fitzgerald died in nineteen forty, at the age of forty-four, his money was gone, and so was his fame. Most people could not believe that he had not died years before.</p>\r\n<p>The problem was that he was so much a part of the age he described, the &quot;Roaring Twenties.&quot; So when the period ended people thought he must have ended with it.</p>\r\n<p>STEVE EMBER: The nineteen twenties began with high hopes. World War One, the &quot;War to End All Wars,&quot; was over. The twenties ended with a huge drop in stock market prices that began the Great Depression. Fitzgerald was a representative of the years of fast living in between.</p>\r\n<p>The nation\'s values had changed. Many Americans were concerned mainly with having a good time. People broke the law by drinking alcohol. They danced to jazz music. Women wore short skirts.</p>\r\n<p>Money differences between one group of Americans and another had become sharper at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>\r\n<p>By the nineteen twenties, many people believed that gaining the material things one desired could bring happiness. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote about the lives of people who lived as if that were true.</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: There was more to Fitzgerald than a desire for material things. &quot;The test of a first-rate intelligence,&quot; he said, &quot;is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still have the ability to act.&quot; His two opposing ideas involved seeking happiness from material things, and knowing that material things only brought unhappiness.</p>\r\n<p>Of his own time, he said: &quot;There seemed no question about what was going to happen. America was going on the greatest party in its history and there was going to be plenty to tell about.&quot; Yet if he described only the party, his writings would have been forgotten when the party ended.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;All the stories that came into my head,&quot; he said, &quot;had a touch of unhappiness in them. The lovely young women in my stories were ruined; the diamond mountains exploded. In life these things had not happened yet. But I was sure that living was not the careless business that people thought. &quot;</p>\r\n<p>Fitzgerald was able to experience the wild living of the period yet write about its effect on people as though he were just an observer. That is a major reason his writings still are popular.</p>\r\n<p>(Music)</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSTEVE EMBER: Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald was born in the middle western city of Saint Paul, Minnesota. He grew up there. In his mother\'s family there were southern landowners and politicians. The member of the family for whom he was named had written the words to &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; America\'s national song.</p>\r\n<p>His father was a businessman who did not do well. Scott went to free public schools and, when he was fifteen, a costly private school where he learned how the rich lived. <br />\r\nWhen F. Scott Fitzgerald was seventeen, he entered Princeton University.</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Fitzgerald was not a good student. He spent more time writing for school plays and magazines at Princeton than studying. His poor record troubled him less than the fact that he was not a good enough athlete to be on the university\'s football team.</p>\r\n<p>University officials warned him he had to do better in his studies or he would be expelled. So he decided to leave the university after three years to join the United States Army. It was World War One, but the war ended before he saw active duty.</p>\r\n<p>He met his future wife while he was at one of the bases where he trained. The girl, Zelda Sayre, was a local beauty in the southern city of Montgomery, Alabama. She and Fitzgerald agreed to marry. Then she rejected him when her family said that Fitzgerald could not give her the life she expected.</p>\r\n<p>STEVE EMBER: Fitzgerald was crushed. He went to New York City in nineteen nineteen with two goals. One was to make a lot of money. The other was to win the girl he loved.</p>\r\n<p>He rewrote and completed a novel that he had started in college. The book, &ldquo;This Side of Paradise,&rdquo; was published in nineteen twenty. It was an immediate success.</p>\r\n<p>Fitzgerald told his publisher that he did not expect more than twenty thousand copies of the book to be sold. The publisher laughed and said five thousand copies of a first novel would be very good. Within one week, however, twenty thousand copies of the book were sold.</p>\r\n<p>At twenty-four, Fitzgerald was famous and rich. A week after the novel appeared, Scott and Zelda were married. F. Scott Fitzgerald had gained the two goals he had set for himself. <br />\r\nAt this point the fairy tale should end with the expression: &quot;They lived happily ever after.&quot; But that was not to be the ending for the Fitzgeralds.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Fitzgerald is reported to have said to his friend, the American writer Ernest Hemingway: &quot;The very rich are different from you and me.&quot; Hemingway is reported to have answered: &ldquo;Yes, they have more money.&quot; The exchange tells a great deal about each writer. Hemingway saw a democratic world where people were measured by their ability, not by what they owned.</p>\r\n<p>Fitzgerald saw the deep differences between groups of people that money creates. He decided to be among the rich.</p>\r\n<p>To do this he sold short stories to magazines and, when he had time, continued to write novels. He also continued to live as though his life was one long party.</p>\r\n<p>For several years he was successful at everything. Editors paid more for a story by Fitzgerald than by any other writer. And he sold everything he wrote. Some stories were very good. He wrote very fast, though. So some stories were bad. Even the bad ones, however, had a spirit and a life that belonged to Fitzgerald. As soon as he had enough good stories, he collected them in a book.</p>\r\n<p>STEVE EMBER: Fitzgerald quickly learned that a life of partying all the time did not help him write his best. But he could not give up the fun.</p>\r\n<p>Scott and Zelda lived in New York City. He drank too much. She spent too much money. He promised himself to live a less costly life. Always, however, he spent more than he earned from writing.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the individual stories, two collections of his stories, &ldquo;Flappers and Philosophers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tales of the Jazz Age,&rdquo; appeared in nineteen twenty and nineteen twenty-two. A second novel, &ldquo;The Beautiful and Damned,&rdquo; also was published in nineteen twenty-two.</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: The novel was well received, but it was nothing like the success of his first novel.</p>\r\n<p>Fitzgerald was unhappy with the critics and unhappy with the money the book earned. He and his wife moved to France with their baby daughter. They made many friends among the Americans who had fled to Paris. But they failed to cut their living costs. Fitzgerald was always in debt. He owed money to his publisher and the man who helped to sell his writings. In his stories he says repeatedly that no one can have everything. He seemed to try, though. It looked for a brief time like he might succeed.</p>\r\n<p>STEVE EMBER: Fitzgerald continued to be affected by the problems that would finally kill him -- the drinking and the debts. Yet by nineteen twenty-five his best novel, &ldquo;The Great Gatsby,&rdquo; was published.</p>\r\n<p>It is the story of a young man\'s search for his idea of love. It also is a story of what the young man must do to win that love before he discovers that it is not worth having. <br />\r\nNext week we shall discuss this important novel. And we shall tell you about the rest of Fitzgerald\'s short life.</p>','http://s5.hxen.com/m2/voa/2010/11/20101121a.mp3');

The Tanzanian was the first terrorism suspect held at Guantanamo ever to face trial in a civilian court instead of a military court.</p>\r\n<p>He was charged in the al-Qaida bombings of the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya on August seventh, nineteen ninety-eight. The attacks killed two hundred twenty-four people, including twelve Americans.</p>\r\n<p>Government lawyers said Mr. Ghailani bought the truck and tanks of gas used in the bombing in Tanzania. The government brought two hundred eighty-five charges against him, mostly for murder.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBut the twelve-member jury found him guilty of just one charge: conspiracy to destroy United States property with an explosive device. The crime carries a sentence of at least twenty years in prison and a possible life sentence.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Ghailani is thirty-six. He faces sentencing in January.</p>\r\n<p>He was the fifth person found guilty in the embassy bombings. The other four were also tried in civilian court in New York and received life sentences in two thousand one. But they had never been held at the American military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>\r\n<p>Senator Joe Lieberman says the jury\'s decision makes it highly unlikely there will be many more civilian trials of Guantanamo detainees. Senator Lieberman, an Independent, heads the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.</p>\r\n<p>JOE LIEBERMAN: &quot;To me, we are in a war. And people you capture in a war should be held in a military setting.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>But Tom Malinowski of the group Human Rights Watch defended the jury\'s verdict, after a trial in a city that was also attacked by al-Qaida.</p>\r\n<p>TOM MALINOWSKI: &quot;It shows that American courts and American juries are independent and thoughtful and take their responsibilities very, very seriously.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Republican Representative John Boehner --&nbsp; soon to become the speaker of the House -- urged President Obama to try future suspects in military courts. The president wants to close Guantanamo, but the Ghailani verdict could make it even harder for him to get Congress to agree.</p>\r\n<p>Defense lawyer Peter Quijano told the court that al-Qaida members tricked Mr. Ghailani into unknowingly helping them. He says the defense team will appeal the conviction on the single charge.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Ghailani was captured six years ago in Pakistan. The Central Intelligence Agency held him there for two years before he arrived at Guantanamo.</p>\r\n<p>The government\'s case suffered a setback before the trial began. Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected evidence from a government witness. Hussein Abebe was expected to tell the court that he had sold explosives to Mr. Ghailani.</p>\r\n<p>But Judge Kaplan said the government violated Mr. Ghailani\'s constitutional rights. The judge said Mr. Abebe was identified as a direct result of statements made by Mr. Ghailani under duress while held by the CIA. Mr. Ghailani\'s lawyers say he was tortured. The government would not discuss details of his treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Tom Malinowski of Human Rights Watch thinks a military court would have reached the same decision as the civilian jury.</p>\r\n<p>TOM MALINOWSKI: &quot;The military commissions have been reformed by the Congress and the Obama administration in a way that prohibits absolutely the use of any evidence obtained through torture or cruelty.&quot;</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>','http://s5.hxen.com/m2/voa/2010/11/20101120a.mp3');

I think that kind of captures it. Anecdotally I would say that things are gradually just across time, actually getting worse and worse for ordinary people.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Burma is one of Asia\'s poorest countries, and there are estimates that nearly a third of the population lives in extreme poverty.</p>\r\n<p>Burdensome Taxation</p>\r\n<p>A Macquarie University study found Burma\'s taxation system was onerous, often included forced labor, the forced purchasing of goods and confiscation of land. Poor road and port infrastructure also hampers development.</p>\r\n<p>Hopes have risen among some economists and regional analysts that elections held November 7th, the first in 20 years, may lead to more openness in the economy, which the military government dominates.</p>\r\n<p>But Debbie Stothard, the spokeswoman for the rights group the Alternative ASEAN Network, expects little change.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;It\'s a crisis situation for many parts of rural Burma where people are actually unable to grow food to feed themselves because of land confiscation, because of over-taxation by the authorities and just simply the lack of opportunities,&quot; Stothard said. &quot;Most people felt very cynical and unhappy about the Burmese elections. The elections brought more taxes.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Corruption rampant</p>\r\n<p>Burma\'s government is considered highly corrupt. And many governments, including the United States, have imposed economic sanctions on the government because of its human rights abuses.</p>\r\n<p>But that has not stopped some foreign investors. Thailand is Burma\'s leading investor, particularly in natural gas and oil.</p>\r\n<p>China also is major investor and trade partner, especially in the energy sector.</p>\r\n<p>Burma\'s other main exports are timber and precious stones, which draw investors from Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and India.</p>\r\n<p>Bertil Lintner, an author who has written extensively about Burma, says despite the investment, the economy remains weak because of government mismanagement.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;There is virtually no capital investment in the country, there\'s no investment in manufacturing or anything that could really produce substantial economic growth,&quot; Lintner said.</p>\r\n<p>Over the past year, the government sold off millions of dollars of assets, including ports and transportation systems, to businesses and military officers close to the top leaders.</p>\r\n<p>Stothard at the Alternative ASEAN Network says that likely added the people\'s burdens.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;It\'s actually concentrating ownership of the main economic opportunities of the country,&quot; Stothard added. &quot;So that\'s going to mean for most people in Burma prices will increase and their opportunities to make money will decrease.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Economic and political reform</p>\r\n<p>But some Burma experts say the sales could dilute the military\'s economic power and help create an entrepreneurial class.</p>\r\n<p>The government\'s decision to free opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from years of detention this month has opened discussion about whether economic sanctions should be eased. Aung San Suu Kyi has indicated she is considering the idea, after years of endorsing sanctions.</p>\r\n<p>Critics say that as long as countries such as China and India ignore sanctions, they only impoverish ordinary people and enrich the leadership.</p>\r\n<p>But author Lintner says the sanctions need to stay until the military makes more reforms.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Sanctions would not be removed without any concessions on the part of the government,&quot; said Lintner. &quot;That was the whole purpose of introducing sanctions in the first place. Now unless there are some significant changes in the present policies of the regime, I cannot see that she would advocate the removal of sanctions. Sanctions are there for a purpose &ndash; that is the political pressure point.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Uncertainty looms large</p>\r\n<p>Because of the uncertainties over how the newly elected government will handle the economy, and over sanctions, potential investors are expected remain wary of Burma. And, Burma scholars say, it is likely the country will continue to lag behind in a region that has powered ahead economically.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>','http://s5.hxen.com/m2/standard/2010/11/20101123c.mp3');

She\'s played a witch, nun, dying mother, drunken grandmother, a fugitive and even herself on the television show, &quot;The Simpsons.&quot;There\'s another role that she\'s taken on for decades and has no plans to give up: activist. The 64-year-old has said that at the root of both acting and activism is imagination. She\'s able to imagine herself in someone else\'s shoes - and wants to use her fame to help them.</p>\r\n<p>Early years</p>\r\n<p>Susan Sarandon - the activist - arrived on center stage before the actress. The former Susan Tomalin was studying drama at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. at the start of a turbulent era.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;You know, I just came of age at a time when, if you had any brain at all, the end of 60s, beginning of the 70s, they stopped, we stopped a war. You had sex drugs and rock and roll but you were also in the streets and it made a difference,&quot; she says. &quot;There\'s no one else in my family that has this problem. I\'m the only one.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Sarandon grew up the eldest of nine children, sleeping in bunk beds in a crowded but happy house in Edison, New Jersey. Her father was a big band singer before becoming an advertising executive, and was often belting out tunes. She was barred from singing due to a voice that her father deemed terrible. Yet in 1975, in one of her first big roles, Sarandon acted and sang as Janet, a good girl gone bad, in &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; <br />\r\nThe movie \'Bull Durham\' was a turning point in Susan Sarandon\'s career, catapulting her into Hollywood\'s major leagues.</p>\r\n<p>Gaining ground</p>\r\n<p>Sarandon kept honing her craft, becoming an art-house favorite. Louis Malle\'s &quot;Atlantic City&quot; in 1980 earned her an Academy Award nomination. At that point, her marriage to her college sweetheart, Chris Sarandon, had ended but she kept his surname.</p>\r\n<p>In the mid-80s, she had a daughter with an Italian director and was living in Rome. After reading a script that captivated her, she decided to fly to the U.S. at her own expense to fight for the role. Paul Zinder, associate professor of the American University of Rome, says that ended up being the movie that catapulted Sarandon into the major leagues.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;If you\'re to look at Sarandon\'s kind of coming out party, it was Bull Durham in 1988,&quot; says Zinder.</p>\r\n<p>In the film, Sarandon plays an English teacher and baseball devotee who selects a minor-league player each year to seduce and educate about poetry, baseball and life.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;What was unique about Sarandon\'s role in that film is that she is, first of all, non-conventional looking for a Hollywood sex goddess, so to speak,&quot; says Zinder. &quot;However, her confidence was quite clear to everyone who watched that film and really her comedic gifts as well related directly to her sexual confidence.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Hollywood directors noticed, putting her among the A-list actresses.</p>\r\n<p>Functional fame</p>\r\n<p>Sarandon realized her fame could serve another function.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&quot;After I became a celebrity, it just seemed to make so much sense to be able to use my celebrity to get press to go somewhere where they weren\'t going to cover the early days of AIDs, for instance, or sex trafficking.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; <br />\r\nActress Susan Sarandon addresses the Plenary following her nomination as FAO Goodwill Ambassador by FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf at the World Food Day Ceremony in Rome, Italy. (October 2010)</p>\r\n<p>Sarandon is a passionate advocate for human rights, social justice and programs dedicated to ending poverty and hunger.&nbsp; A staunch liberal who opposes the death penalty, she saw her art and activism meet in the 1995 film &quot;Dead Man Walking.&quot;&nbsp; She won an Academy Award for her portrayal of a nun who counsels a death-row inmate.</p>\r\n<p>This fall, she accepted a new challenge from the United Nations\' Food and Agriculture Association. Director-General Jacques Diouf invited her to help feed the world\'s one billion hungry people.</p>\r\n<p>In her UN role, Sarandon has addressed diplomats and aid workers from every corner of the globe. Her knowledge of the issues rivals the experts. Yet she also brings humanity to her mission.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;As a mother, I can\'t imagine anything more upsetting, demoralizing, frustrating than not being able to feed your child.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Art and activism</p>\r\n<p>The head of the US mission to the UN agencies in Rome - Ambassador Ertharin Cousin - is thrilled to have Sarandon on board, knowing she\'ll help put hunger in the headlines.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;The biggest challenge we have today is not the work that we\'re doing but maintaining the public will to continue that work. So having someone with her fame who is willing to lend that fame not just for her own benefit but for those hungry people around the world, we are delighted and very excited about this opportunity,&quot; says Cousin. &quot;But what was so exciting for me was that underneath all of those characters that I\'ve so enjoyed watching in the movies is a real person who cares.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Sarandon shows no signs of slowing down with her art or activism. She still gets acting work - probably due to her willingness to embrace her age and return to her roots in independent films and television. It\'s the 1960s rebel in her, always seeking meaning in her life and work.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>','http://s5.hxen.com/m2/standard/2010/11/20101123b.mp3');

In rural areas, many people rely on rivers and streams from which to wash, bath and drink. The Artibonite River, identified as a possible source of the outbreak, winds through vast areas of the country north of Port au Prince. Now feared unsafe, many residents of the area have nowhere to go for fresh water.</p>\r\n<p>Here, along a tributary of the Artibonite River is where some of the first cholera cases in Haiti were reported. More than 50 residents of the impoverished neighborhood of Villa, North of Saint Marc, have died so far. Many - like Evans Monee - are looking for answers.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;We don\'t know where it came from,&quot; said Monee. &quot;But we know this was one of the first places where cholera was found, and a lot of people died because we have no clean water.

Even if we wanted to clean them up, what water could we clean them up with?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>The Artibonite plane, a few hours North of the capital, Port au Prince, consists of rich agricultural lands fed by the river. Allegations that cholera was brought to Haiti by Nepalese U.N. Peacekeepers camped up stream, led to violent protests last week, though the source of the outbreak has not been determined.</p>\r\n<p>None of that concerns the residents of Villa. They worry about where they will get safe water. Monee told us there are three sources for water in the area: river and well water, which are considered unsafe. And water from this chlorine treatment tank, donated by an NGO. (Non-government organization).</p>\r\n<p>&quot;A white man came and gave us this machine,&quot; said Monee. &quot;But the problem is, the water is so bitter, no one likes to drink it.&nbsp; When I drink it, it gives me a stomach ache.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Some in the neighborhood drink river water treated with purification tablets, but there have been questions about their effectiveness. Pierre Leroi said his mother died after drinking river water treated with tablets. &quot;We took my mother to the hospital, but they did not know what she had and released her. She died a day later.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Leroi is the eldest of eight children. His father is no longer with the family. Now, he must provide for his younger brothers and sisters.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;There are no jobs here and we have no money,&quot; said Leroi. &quot;We don\'t have much food, and sometimes we go without.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>The medical organization Doctors Without Borders has set up a cholera clinic at the hospital in Saint Marc to assist local doctors, one of 21 facilities around the country. They have brought their cholera treatment expertise to Haiti. Haitian physician Dr. August Berthin told us cholera fatalities at the hospital are now rare.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;This has been a great experience with Doctors Without Borders,&quot; said Berthin. &quot;And every time we save a life, it makes me happy.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>For the people of Villa, that is little consolation.

The goal is to teach them to avoid bad choices and bad influences that could put them behind bars for life.</p>\r\n<p>Students can take a tour of the prison, in school groups or by themselves. At the end, the young people sit down for a discussion with some of the inmates.</p>\r\n<p>The program is called Prisoners Against Teen Tragedy, or PATT. It takes place at the Maryland Correctional Institution-Hagerstown, a medium-security prison for men. Sal Mauriello is a case specialist there.</p>\r\n<p>SAL MAURIELLO: &quot;We have a group of eleven inmates who are in the PATT program. They tell the youth what they went through as a child, what their crimes consist of. They try to teach them about peer pressure.&nbsp; They try to teach them about bad choices.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>The Prisoners Against Teen Tragedy program also includes an essay-writing contest.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nScholarship winner Tomi Dare speaks to inmates</p>\r\n<p>Tomi Dare is a seventeen-year-old student at Hagerstown Community College. She saw an announcement for the contest on her college website. To enter, students had to write about peer pressure and why they do not do drugs. The prize: five hundred dollars for school.</p>\r\n<p>In her essay, Ms. Dare wrote about her own experience growing up as an African-American girl interested in sports.</p>\r\n<p>TOMI DARE: &quot;Drugs and alcohol not only slow a person down, it doesn\'t make you feel like you are a winner. It doesn\'t make you feel like you are the best. As an athlete, I\'m 6-2 [188 centimeters], so I feel that I should be above peer pressure because I\'m bigger than everybody that I&rsquo;m around.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;So I was talking about that and I was talking about how I consider myself a queen. And if I&rsquo;m royalty, I need to not put substances in my body. Drugs and alcohol are not what a queen should be taking.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>The scholarship is presented by the Prisoners Against Teen Tragedy program.</p>\r\n<p>Prison spokesman Mark Vernarelli says most teens who visit come to understand what even one bad decision can mean.</p>\r\n<p>MARK VERNARELLI: &quot;A lot of men and women serving life in prison in the state of Maryland didn\'t pull a trigger or plunge a knife into anybody. They were accessories to a crime. They drove the getaway car. They were with the perpetrator who did the main part of the crime. And yet they got the life sentence as well. &quot;</p>\r\n<p>Prisoners Against Teen Tragedy began in nineteen eighty-eight. PATT is one of Maryland\'s oldest programs to keep young people from a life of crime. But there are also others.</p>\r\n<p>MARK VERNARELLI: &quot;We found that girls really need special sit-down sessions sometimes more than the boys do, so we have a program for girls only. We have a program that travels across the state, which talks about the dangers of gang affiliation.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;We have an excellent program where the inmates actually lead a tour and they have the children eat the meal in the prison cafeteria with the inmates.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Mark Vernarelli says the Prisoners Against Teen Tragedy also gain from the program. It offers them a chance to help repay society for their crimes, and keep others from following in their footsteps.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>','http://s5.hxen.com/m2/voa/2010/11/20101111b.mp3');

But not until seven months later was a treaty signed to officially end what was known as the Great War and the War to End All Wars.</p>\r\n<p>This week in our series, Shirley Griffith and Larry West continue the story of the peace conference following World War One.</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: American President Woodrow Wilson was one of the chief negotiators at the conference in Paris. Throughout the early months of nineteen nineteen, he struggled hard for a treaty that would result in peace with justice for all sides.</p>\r\n<p>Wilson demanded a treaty that provided for a new international organization. He called it the League of Nations. To Wilson, the league was more important than any other part of the treaty.</p>\r\n<p>Not all Americans shared Wilson\'s opinion. Many feared the league would take away the power of the American government to declare war and make treaties. They also agreed with the leaders of the other allied nations. Establishing the league was less important than punishing the defeated enemy.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nLeft to right: Britain\'s Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Italy\'s Premier Vittorio Orlando, France\'s Premier Georges Clemenceau, and President Woodrow Wilson on June 28, 1919.</p>\r\n<p>LARRY WEST: The other major allied leaders at the peace conference were Prime Minister David Lloyd-George of Britain, Premier Georges Clemenceau of France, and Premier Vittorio Otto of Italy.</p>\r\n<p>Lloyd-George, Clemenceau, and Otto understood how much Wilson wanted the League of Nations. They used this knowledge to win Wilson\'s approval for other parts of the peace treaty.</p>\r\n<p>Wilson soon learned that, to get the league, he had to compromise on many issues. For example, he had to accept British and French demands to make Germany pay all war damages. The payments added up to more than three hundred thousand million dollars. Wilson also had to accept the allied takeover of Germany\'s colonies.</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Some of Wilson\'s compromises violated his belief in self-determination. This was the right of all people to decide for themselves who would govern them.</p>\r\n<p>One compromise, for example, gave to Japan Germany\'s colonial rights in the Shantung area of China. China protested the decision. It asked that control of Shantung be returned to the Chinese government. But President Wilson needed Japan\'s support for the League of Nations. So he accepted Japan\'s demand for control of Shantung.</p>\r\n<p>There were other violations of the policy of self-determination. These affected the people and land along the borders of several European nations.</p>\r\n<p>For example, three million Germans were made citizens of the new nation of Czechoslovakia. Millions of other Germans were forced into the newly formed nation of Poland. And Italy received territory that had belonged to Austria.</p>\r\n<p>LARRY WEST: Today, most history experts agree Woodrow Wilson was correct in opposing these decisions. They say Germany\'s loss of territory and citizens caused deep bitterness. And the bitterness helped lead to the rise of fascist dictator Adolph Hitler in the nineteen thirties.</p>\r\n<p>In East Asia, Japanese control over parts of China created serious tensions. Both decisions helped plant the seeds for the bloody harvest of World War Two twenty years later. But allied leaders at the Paris peace conference were not looking far into the future. As one person said at the time: &quot;They divided Europe like people cutting up a tasty pie.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: After months of negotiations, the peace treaty was completed. The Allies gave it to a German delegation on May seventh, nineteen-nineteen. The head of the delegation objected immediately. He said the treaty was unfair. He urged his government not to sign it.</p>\r\n<p>At first, Germany did not sign. The leader of the government refused and resigned in protest. But a new government was formed. And its leader signed the document at a ceremony at the palace in Versailles outside Paris.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, World War One was officially over.</p>\r\n<p>LARRY WEST: President Woodrow Wilson returned to the United States after the treaty signing ceremony. He was not completely satisfied with the treaty. Yet he believed it was still valuable, because it established the League of Nations.</p>\r\n<p>Wilson\'s battle for the league was only half over when the treaty was signed in Europe. He had to win approval from the United States Senate. That half of the battle would not be easy.</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Part of the problem was political. Wilson was a member of the Democratic Party. The Senate was controlled by the Republican Party. Also, Wilson had refused to name any important Republicans to his negotiating team at the peace conference.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nHenry Cabot Lodge</p>\r\n<p>Part of the problem was personal. A number of senators disliked Wilson. One was Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. Lodge was the powerful chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He told a friend he never expected to hate anyone as much as he hated Wilson.</p>\r\n<p>LARRY WEST: Wilson spoke before the Senate just two days after he returned from Europe. He urged it to approve the peace treaty.</p>\r\n<p>Wilson said: &quot;The united power of free nations must put a stop to aggression. And the world must be given peace. Shall we and any other free people refuse to accept this great duty? Dare we reject it and break the heart of the world? We cannot turn back. America shall show the way. The light streams upon the path ahead and nowhere else.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee began hearings on the treaty. It heard a number of people who opposed the League of Nations. They said the league would destroy the freedom and independence of the United States.</p>\r\n<p>The committee completed its hearings and prepared a report for the full Senate. The report said the United States should reject the treaty, unless changes were made. The committee proposed almost forty changes.</p>\r\n<p>LARRY WEST: The committee\'s report was a blow to President Wilson both politically and personally. He had worked extremely hard to win Europe\'s support for the idea of a league of nations. Great crowds in Paris had cheered him and his idea. Now, the Senate of his own country was about to reject it.</p>\r\n<p>Wilson decided he must take his case out of the hands of the peoples\' representatives. He would take the case directly to the people themselves. He would build public support for the treaty. If enough citizens supported it, he believed, the Senate could not reject it.</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: President Wilson planned a speaking trip all across the country. His family and his doctor urged him not to go. They said he was still weak from a recent sickness. But Wilson refused the advice. He said the treaty was more important to him than his own life.</p>\r\n<p>The president left Washington in early September. He traveled in a special train.</p>\r\n<p>In city after city, he made speeches and rode in parades. He shook thousands of hands. At times, he suffered from a painful headache. But there was no time to rest.</p>\r\n<p>LARRY WEST: Everywhere Wilson stopped, he urged the people to support the League of Nations. It was, he said, the only hope for peace.</p>\r\n<p>In Boulder, Colorado, ten thousand people waited to hear him. By then, Wilson was extremely weak. He had to be helped up the steps of the building where he was to speak. He made the speech. He said he was working to honor the men who had died in the war. He said he was working for the children of the world.</p>\r\n<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Wilson put all his heart and energy into his speeches. And, as his family and doctor had warned, the pressure was too great. While in Wichita, Kansas, the pain in his head became terrible. He could not speak clearly. His face seemed frozen. A blood vessel had broken in his brain. Wilson had suffered a stroke.</p>\r\n<p>The president was forced to return to Washington. His condition got worse every day. Soon, he was unable to move.</p>\r\n<p>Woodrow Wilson would spend the rest of his presidency as a terribly sick man. He continued to hold on to his dreams of a League of Nations. But his dreams now filled a broken body.</p>\r\n<p>We will continue our story next week.</p>\r\n<p>(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>BOB DOUGHTY: Our program was written by Frank Beardsley.

Today we tell about the award-winning writer Pearl S. Buck.</p>\r\n<p>(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p>FAITH LAPIDUS: The year was nineteen thirty-one.&nbsp; Americans were suffering through the Great Depression.&nbsp; The famous criminal Al Capone was sent to prison for not paying his taxes.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Star Spangled Banner&rdquo; officially became America&rsquo;s national song.&nbsp; The Empire State Building in New York City was completed.&nbsp; And the top selling book in the United States was &ldquo;The Good Earth&rdquo; by Pearl S. Buck.</p>\r\n<p>(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nJIM TEDDER: Pearl Buck won the Pulitzer Prize for the best novel by an American writer.&nbsp; She was the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.&nbsp; She wrote more than one hundred books.&nbsp; She also wrote short stories, poetry, plays, essays and children&rsquo;s literature.&nbsp; But most people remember Pearl Buck for her novels about China.&nbsp; She knew the country and its people very well.&nbsp; For nearly forty years, China was her home.</p>\r\n<p>FAITH LAPIDUS: Pearl&rsquo;s parents were Caroline and Absalom Sydenstricker.&nbsp; They were religious workers in China.&nbsp; In eighteen ninety-two they were visiting in the United States when Pearl was born in Hillsboro, West Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp; Three months after her birth, the family left the United States and moved back to China.</p>\r\n<p>Pearl and her family lived among the Chinese people.&nbsp; Pearl played with Chinese children and visited their homes.&nbsp; She listened to their ideas and learned about their culture.&nbsp; From an early age, she spoke both Chinese and English.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nPearl S. Buck on her 80th birthday.</p>\r\n<p>JIM TEDDER: Pearl&rsquo;s education began at home.&nbsp; Her mother taught her many of the things she would have learned in an American school. A Chinese tutor taught Pearl other subjects. They included the writings of the famous thinker Confucius and Chinese reading, writing and history.&nbsp; When she was seven, she began reading the works of British writer Charles Dickens. Many years later, after she had become a famous author, she said that Dickens&rsquo; writing style had the greatest influence on her own style.</p>\r\n<p>FAITH LAPIDUS: In nineteen ten, Pearl went back to the United States to study philosophy at Randolph-Macon Woman&rsquo;s College in Lynchburg, Virginia.&nbsp; After graduation, she returned to China. Three years later, she met John Lossing Buck.&nbsp; He was a religious worker who studied agriculture.&nbsp; They were married and moved to a small village in the north of China.&nbsp; Their life among the poorest people provided the subject matter for many of the books she later wrote.</p>\r\n<p>(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p>JIM TEDDER: In nineteen twenty, Pearl and John Buck&rsquo;s first child was born.&nbsp; Her name was Carol.&nbsp; Doctors found that Carol had an unusual disease called PKU.&nbsp; This caused her to have trouble learning.&nbsp; Carol was sent to live at a special school in New Jersey.&nbsp; Pearl Buck was deeply saddened by having to send her only child to live far away from home.&nbsp; She also learned that she would never be able to give birth again.</p>\r\n<p>But if it had not been for Carol&rsquo;s health problems, her mother might never have become a famous writer.&nbsp; The reason was money.&nbsp; Pearl Buck needed a lot of it over the years to pay for her daughter&rsquo;s care.&nbsp; So she tried writing books about the subject she knew best. Her first novel was called &ldquo;East Wind, West Wind.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It tells the story of a Chinese girl who learns about the western world.&nbsp; But it was Pearl Buck&rsquo;s next book that made her famous and brought the money she needed.</p>\r\n<p>PEARL BUCK: &ldquo;Now when I began to write, not having anything else to write about, I only knew China. And my first very successful book was &ldquo;The Good Earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; I used to say to these young people, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you write about your peasants?&nbsp; They are wonderful people.&rsquo;&nbsp; And they would say,&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh nobody would be interested.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so I said well I&rsquo;m gonna write that book then.&nbsp; If none of you will do it, I will write it.&nbsp; So I wrote &lsquo;The Good Earth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>FAITH LAPIDUS: &ldquo;The Good Earth&rdquo; became the top selling book in the United States in nineteen thirty-one and nineteen thirty-two. Pearl Buck won the Pulitzer Prize. She also received the William Dean Howells Medal from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In nineteen thirty-seven, &ldquo;The Good Earth&rdquo; became an Oscar-winning motion picture. The next year, Pearl S. Buck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>\r\n<p>JIM TEDDER: &ldquo;The Good Earth&rdquo; is the story of a poor Chinese man named Wang Lung.&nbsp; His wife is O-Lan.&nbsp; They work together very hard and finally make enough money to buy some land for a farm.</p>\r\n<p>After a time, they grow enough crops to feed their family well, with some left over to sell.&nbsp; Their lives improve greatly, and they are happy.&nbsp; But the good times do not last.</p>\r\n<p>FAITH LAPIDUS: For a long time it does not rain.&nbsp; The land dries up and no crops will grow.&nbsp; Many people starve to death.&nbsp; Wang sells all he owns, except the land.&nbsp; Once again his family is poor and hungry. They beg on the streets to survive.&nbsp; Wang fears that they will die. But just when it seems that the end is near, good luck arrives.</p>\r\n<p>JIM TEDDER: Poor people attack some rich people, hoping to get food and money.&nbsp; A crowd forces Wang into a rich man&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; The rich man fears Wang and gives him gold coins.&nbsp; With this new-found wealth, Wang and his family survive.&nbsp; Every chance he gets, he buys more land.&nbsp; After a while he is richer than he ever thought he would be. For the rest of his life, Wang finds happiness in owning land and raising crops. He tells his sons that after he dies, they must never sell their land.</p>\r\n<p>PEARL BUCK: &ldquo;Now you couldn&rsquo;t imagine anything less interesting to Americans, you would say, than a book like &lsquo;The Good Earth.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; It came in the midst of depression times.&nbsp; And it was a comfort to the American people to know that there were people worse off than they were.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>FAITH LAPIDUS: In nineteen thirty-two, Pearl Buck wrote a book called &ldquo;Sons.&rdquo;&nbsp; It tells about Wang Lung&rsquo;s family after his death.&nbsp; Three years later, she wrote &ldquo;A House Divided.&rdquo;&nbsp; This book is mostly about Wang Lung&rsquo;s grandson, Wang Yuan, who lives during a time of revolution in China. This book tells how China&rsquo;s people began to change from their old ways to a more modern way of thinking.</p>\r\n<p>Pearl Buck wrote her first books about China at a time when most people in the world knew almost nothing about the Chinese way of life.&nbsp; She told her stories with honesty. Her readers soon learned that the Chinese were far different from the way they had been shown in Hollywood movies.</p>\r\n<p>(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nPearl S. Buck\'s home, Greenhills Farm, Perkasie, PA.</p>\r\n<p>JIM TEDDER: After almost forty years in China, the writer moved back to the United States.&nbsp; She bought Green Hills Farm in eastern Pennsylvania. She began to write articles for newspapers and magazines.&nbsp; She expressed her opinion on war, politics, religion, equal rights for all people and many other subjects.</p>\r\n<p>PEARL BUCK: &ldquo;One of the sad things about war is ...it&rsquo;s not so much that you lose the money because you can always make money, somehow. But you lose people that you can&rsquo;t replace &hellip; the people who should lead our country are the best, who die early &hellip; the bravest, the most brilliant, the ones with the best leadership &hellip; and they are the ones who die, out of proportion to their numbers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>FAITH LAPIDUS: Pearl Buck&rsquo;s ideas often brought her criticism.&nbsp; But she continued to speak and write about her support for the civil rights of black people in the United States.&nbsp; She also believed in birth control and equal rights for women.&nbsp; She said that there would be world peace only when all races had respect for each other.</p>\r\n<p>PEARL BUCK: &ldquo;We are one world and if we don&rsquo;t know it, it&rsquo;s dangerous. But I think we are beginning to know it more and more, and that does not mean that we give up our nationhood or our differences.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>JIM TEDDER: Pearl Buck gave many speeches in America.&nbsp; She talked to young people about the importance of a good education.&nbsp; She told them they needed to know more about other people around the world.</p>\r\n<p>PEARL BUCK: &ldquo;I beg of you to pay special attention to your history.&nbsp; Not just the history of the United States, but the history of the countries with which we are involved.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>FAITH LAPIDUS: In nineteen forty-nine, Pearl Buck helped start the Welcome House Adoption Agency.&nbsp; She had become very concerned about the children of mixed races around the world.&nbsp; She urged families to adopt these children without concern for the color of their skin or their cultural background. Pearl and her second husband, Richard Walsh, raised seven adopted children.&nbsp; Two of these were of mixed race.&nbsp; They also cared for many other children while they lived at Green Hills Farm.</p>\r\n<p>(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p>JIM TEDDER: Pearl Buck died in nineteen seventy-three.&nbsp; She was eighty years old.&nbsp; She was buried near her house in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Her memory lives on in the work done by Pearl S.

South Korea&rsquo;s President Lee Myung-Bak ordered the army to retaliate with missile strikes in the event of further North Korean attacks. The US State Department described the shelling as a &ldquo;stunning provocation&rdquo;. From the UN, here is Barbara Plett.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBan Ki-moon said the artillery attack was one of the gravest incidents since the Korean War ended in 1953. He condemned it and called for immediate restraint. In a telephone, he conveyed his concerns to the current president of the Security Council, the British ambassador Mark Lyall Grant. Mr Lyall Grant told reporters he was in touch with council members about what to do next. No country has formally requested an emergency session and the UN will wait to hear what South Korea might want for such a meeting, but North Korea&rsquo;s deputy ambassador said this was something that should be discussed by the two Koreas and not by the Security Council. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDefence analysts in Washington say the insurgency in Afghanistan is growing in strength and the levels of violence have reached new highs.

It depicts an enemy which has the support in Iran and continuing safe access to safe havens on the Pakistan border. The western alliance has something like 150,000 troops in Afghanistan, around two thirds are of American. The enemy that&rsquo;s fighting emergency in the Pentagon report is resilient, adaptable and sophisticated. The report saying the Taliban is drawing strength from a belief among the Afghan people that Nato forces will soon leave the country, clearing the way for a Taliban victory. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA report from the United Nations environment programme suggests voluntary pledges on cutting carbon emissions have been so ineffective that global temperatures could double to four degree Celsius.

They conclude that even the most optimistic reading of the pledges suggest they are not enough to prevent temperatures rising beyond levels that most governments considered dangerous. A rise about to four Celsius over the course of the century is feasible. The UN is putting an optimistic slant on the figures, saying they represent a good first step, but many would argue that scientific understanding of climate change means the time for first steps is long gone. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinancial markets across much of the European Union have fallen significantly, reflecting continued concern over the economic future of countries such as Spain and Portugal as well as the already troubled Ireland and Greece.

Dublin is struggling with a public deficit expected to be more than 30 percent higher than its gross domestic product this year. That is roughly 10 times more than the cap set for the 16 members of the eurozone, and three times more than Greece\'s deficit.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhile Athens received a $150-billion rescue package, though, the Irish government has not sought a state bailout, although it has suggested it may ask for help for Irish banks.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, yields or interest rates for Ireland\'s bonds have soared during the past week, driving down the value of the bonds. Analysts say other financially struggling EU members - like Portugal and Spain - also will find it harder and more expensive to borrow to finance their debts. That is why some analysts fear that, without help, Ireland\'s fiscal problems could spread.</p>\r\n<p>In remarks to reporters last week, European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso sought to calm the concerns.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;What is important to know is that we have all the necessary instruments in place now in the European Union and the Eurozone to act, if necessary,&quot; said Barroso. &quot;But I am not going to make any kind of speculation. What is important is, of course, to support the very important efforts the Irish authorities are implementing. At the same time, we can reiterate that the European Union is ready to support Ireland.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>On Monday, Portugal\'s finance minister warned that the Irish situation was a danger for other Eurozone members.

We are grateful for that introduction and we\'re grateful you\'re checking out CNN Student News today. We have a very short week for you this week -- just two shows -- so let\'s go ahead and get them started.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFirst up, figuring out a way forward in Afghanistan: the focus of a NATO meeting this past weekend. NATO stands for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It\'s a group of nearly 30 countries; its main goal is to keep those countries safe and free. That is why the alliance is taking part in the Afghanistan war. That conflict seems to be getting more intense. The U.S. is sending a group of battle tanks -- like the ones you see here -- to Afghanistan for the first time since the war started. This is an<span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><strong> escalation </strong></span>of the war, and it\'ll give U.S. troops more firepower in their fight against the Taliban. Suzanne Malveaux covered this NATO meeting. She explains the leaders there weren\'t focused so much on the present as they are on the future.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt\'s the closest thing to an <span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><strong>exit</strong></span> strategy President Obama could get.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWe agreed that early 2011 will mark the beginning of a <span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><strong>transition</strong></span> to Afghan responsibility, and we adopted the goal of Afghan forces taking the lead for security across the country by the end of 2014.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nU.S. and NATO troops remaining in Afghanistan would be focused on training Afghan security forces. Afghan leader Hamid Karzai signed the <span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><strong>pact </strong></span>earlier with NATO allies, expressing optimism.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWe are confident that the transition will succeed to the Afghan authority, leadership and ownership.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBut the agreement is, at best, a goal. Privately, there is real skepticism that the Afghan government will be ready to provide security and services to its people. The new NATO agreement <span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><strong>bluntly </strong></span>states for the Afghan government, corruption remains a central challenge to be addressed.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWe must be guided by realities, not schedules.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nRussia\'s President Dmitry Medvedev also suggested Afghanistan may not be ready.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhether it\'s <span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><strong>feasible</strong></span> in the <span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><strong>forthcoming</strong></span> future, I don\'t know. I have some doubts on that.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPresident Obama himself seemed to leave the door open about whether U.S. troops would still be fighting in Afghanistan after 2014. When asked if he\'d keep U.S. combat troops there after the proposed deadline, he said:&rdquo; So I will always do what\'s necessary to keep the American people safe, and maybe that will be the case in 2014.&rdquo; But President Obama is eager to get U.S. forces out of this unpopular war. He has already pledged to start pulling out American troops in July of next year. NATO allies are even less patient.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBy the end of next year, we have set the goal to have 300,000 Afghan soldiers and Afghan police.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSeveral countries have already said their troops will not remain in combat indefinitely. A senior British official said British Prime Minister David Cameron repeated here that no matter how violent Afghanistan is at the end of 2014, the British will end combat operations by the next year.</p>','http://online1.tingclass.com/voaspe/20101125cnn.mp3');

Scott Fitzgerald\'s most famous book.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;Gatz&quot;</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDOUG JOHNSON: Some theater goers in New York City are experiencing an unusual stage production at the Public Theater. The theatrical group Elevator Repair Service is performing &quot;Gatz,&quot; a reading of the great American novel, &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Faith Lapidus tells about this six-hour play and how the actors read every word of the book while keeping viewers interested.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFAITH LAPIDUS: The Elevator Repair Service created &quot;Gatz&quot; and began performing it in two thousand five. It is the company\'s best known work. &quot;Gatz&quot; has played in many American cities and also overseas. Theater goers have seen the play in Ireland, Australia, Singapore, Austria, Belgium and other places.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHowever, the members of Elevator Repair Service had been wanting for years to perform the play in New York, where the company is based. They had sought permission from the F. Scott Fitzgerald estate which owns the rights to the writer\'s works. Finally, they received permission.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nJohn Collins is the director of &quot;Gatz.&quot; He has not missed a single performance. He has heard the forty-nine thousand words of the novel countless times. Mr. Collins said he was not sure when he started the project if the production would include each word. But then, he told a reporter, he realized that &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was a novel in which every word was necessary.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;Gatz&quot; has thirteen cast members. Scott Shepherd plays Nick Carraway, the lead character. He also narrates most of the novel. The show opens in an office of a small business. An employee finds a copy of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and begins to read it aloud.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n(SOUND)</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSlowly, other workers begin to take part in the events that happen in the book.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n(SOUND)</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is set in the nineteen twenties in New York City and on Long Island. It is a story about success and what one must do to gain it. It is a story about appearance and reality, love, hate, loyalty and disloyalty.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was published in nineteen twenty-five. It was not as successful as Fitzgerald\'s other books during his lifetime. However, it is now considered one of the greatest modern American novels.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nYou can hear more about F. Scott Fitzgerald\'s life and work Sunday on the Special English program PEOPLE IN AMERICA.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWest Point</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDOUG JOHNSON: This week our listener question comes from Xian, China. Meng Cheng wants to know about the famous military school known as West Point.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWest Point, New York, is a small town about eighty kilometers north of New York City. It is the home of the United States Military Academy. Many people speak of the academy as simply &quot;West Point.&quot;</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt was formed in eighteen-oh-two when Thomas Jefferson was president. It is the oldest of the five military colleges in the United States. It also is the oldest continuously occupied military post in the United States. This four-year school has about four thousand four hundred students, or cadets. Both men and women study here before joining the United States Army. After graduation, they are given the rank of second lieutenant.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;usma.gov</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nStudents in Grant Hall at West Point</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt is difficult to become a student at West Point. Only about fifteen percent of students who apply are accepted. High school seniors must have very good grades. They also must be nominated by a member of the United States Congress or by the president of the United States.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nEach year about one thousand new students are chosen. They do not have to pay for their education. All student costs are paid by the United States Army. But the students must agree to serve actively in the Army for at least five years after finishing their studies.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWest Point also accepts a limited number of international students. After graduation they return to their home countries to serve in their country\'s army.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nCadets can take classes in more than forty subject areas. The most popular are foreign languages, management information systems, history, economics and mechanical engineering. The cadets are required to take physical fitness courses. Most of them are also members of sports teams.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAn important part of a student\'s life at West Point concerns the honor code. It says: &quot;A cadet will not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those who do.&quot; This code is enforced both in and out of the classroom.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe students and teachers at the United States Military Academy are proud of their history. Two presidents of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower, graduated from West Point. Many famous generals, astronauts and business leaders have also studied at the academy.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nCMA Awards</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;AP</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMiranda Lambert and Blake Shelton at the CMA Awards</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDOUG JOHNSON: The Country Music Association held its yearly awards program last week.

Every week we tell about someone important in the history of the United States. Today we tell about writer F. Scott Fitzgerald.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Early in nineteen twenty, the American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald was poor and unknown. He was twenty-four years old. The girl he wanted to marry had rejected him. Her family said he could not support her.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nLater that same year, Fitzgerald\'s first novel, &quot;This Side of Paradise,&quot; was accepted for publication. He said that when the news arrived in the mail: &quot;I left my job. I paid my debts, bought a suit of clothes and woke in the morning to a world of promise.&quot;</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe quickly became rich and famous. That year before &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; was published, he said he earned eight hundred dollars by writing. The following year, with his first book published, he earned eighteen thousand dollars by writing.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nYet by the time F. Scott Fitzgerald died in nineteen forty, at the age of forty-four, his money was gone, and so was his fame. Most people could not believe that he had not died years before.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe problem was that he was so much a part of the age he described, the &quot;Roaring Twenties.&quot; So when the period ended people thought he must have ended with it.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSTEVE EMBER: The nineteen twenties began with high hopes. World War One, the &quot;War to End All Wars,&quot; was over. The twenties ended with a huge drop in stock market prices that began the Great Depression. Fitzgerald was a representative of the years of fast living in between.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe nation\'s values had changed. Many Americans were concerned mainly with having a good time. People broke the law by drinking alcohol. They danced to jazz music. Women wore short skirts.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMoney differences between one group of Americans and another had become sharper at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBy the nineteen twenties, many people believed that gaining the material things one desired could bring happiness. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote about the lives of people who lived as if that were true.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSHIRLEY GRIFFITH: There was more to Fitzgerald than a desire for material things. &quot;The test of a first-rate intelligence,&quot; he said, &quot;is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still have the ability to act.&quot; His two opposing ideas involved seeking happiness from material things, and knowing that material things only brought unhappiness.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nOf his own time, he said: &quot;There seemed no question about what was going to happen. America was going on the greatest party in its history and there was going to be plenty to tell about.&quot; Yet if he described only the party, his writings would have been forgotten when the party ended.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;All the stories that came into my head,&quot; he said, &quot;had a touch of unhappiness in them. The lovely young women in my stories were ruined; the diamond mountains exploded. In life these things had not happened yet. But I was sure that living was not the careless business that people thought. &quot;</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFitzgerald was able to experience the wild living of the period yet write about its effect on people as though he were just an observer. That is a major reason his writings still are popular.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n(Music)</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSTEVE EMBER: Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald was born in the middle western city of Saint Paul, Minnesota. He grew up there. In his mother\'s family there were southern landowners and politicians. The member of the family for whom he was named had written the words to &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; America\'s national song.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis father was a businessman who did not do well. Scott went to free public schools and, when he was fifteen, a costly private school where he learned how the rich lived.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhen F. Scott Fitzgerald was seventeen, he entered Princeton University.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Fitzgerald was not a good student. He spent more time writing for school plays and magazines at Princeton than studying. His poor record troubled him less than the fact that he was not a good enough athlete to be on the university\'s football team.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nUniversity officials warned him he had to do better in his studies or he would be expelled. So he decided to leave the university after three years to join the United States Army. It was World War One, but the war ended before he saw active duty.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe met his future wife while he was at one of the bases where he trained. The girl, Zelda Sayre, was a local beauty in the southern city of Montgomery, Alabama. She and Fitzgerald agreed to marry. Then she rejected him when her family said that Fitzgerald could not give her the life she expected.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSTEVE EMBER: Fitzgerald was crushed. He went to New York City in nineteen nineteen with two goals. One was to make a lot of money. The other was to win the girl he loved.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe rewrote and completed a novel that he had started in college. The book, &quot;This Side of Paradise,&quot; was published in nineteen twenty. It was an immediate success.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFitzgerald told his publisher that he did not expect more than twenty thousand copies of the book to be sold. The publisher laughed and said five thousand copies of a first novel would be very good. Within one week, however, twenty thousand copies of the book were sold.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAt twenty-four, Fitzgerald was famous and rich. A week after the novel appeared, Scott and Zelda were married. F. Scott Fitzgerald had gained the two goals he had set for himself.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAt this point the fairy tale should end with the expression: &quot;They lived happily ever after.&quot; But that was not to be the ending for the Fitzgeralds.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Fitzgerald is reported to have said to his friend, the American writer Ernest Hemingway: &quot;The very rich are different from you and me.&quot; Hemingway is reported to have answered: &quot;Yes, they have more money.&quot; The exchange tells a great deal about each writer. Hemingway saw a democratic world where people were measured by their ability, not by what they owned.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFitzgerald saw the deep differences between groups of people that money creates. He decided to be among the rich.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nTo do this he sold short stories to magazines and, when he had time, continued to write novels. He also continued to live as though his life was one long party.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFor several years he was successful at everything. Editors paid more for a story by Fitzgerald than by any other writer. And he sold everything he wrote. Some stories were very good. He wrote very fast, though. So some stories were bad. Even the bad ones, however, had a spirit and a life that belonged to Fitzgerald. As soon as he had enough good stories, he collected them in a book.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSTEVE EMBER: Fitzgerald quickly learned that a life of partying all the time did not help him write his best. But he could not give up the fun.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nScott and Zelda lived in New York City. He drank too much. She spent too much money. He promised himself to live a less costly life. Always, however, he spent more than he earned from writing.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn addition to the individual stories, two collections of his stories, &quot;Flappers and Philosophers,&quot; and &quot;Tales of the Jazz Age,&quot; appeared in nineteen twenty and nineteen twenty-two. A second novel, &quot;The Beautiful and Damned,&quot; also was published in nineteen twenty-two.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSHIRLEY GRIFFITH: The novel was well received, but it was nothing like the success of his first novel.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFitzgerald was unhappy with the critics and unhappy with the money the book earned. He and his wife moved to France with their baby daughter. They made many friends among the Americans who had fled to Paris. But they failed to cut their living costs. Fitzgerald was always in debt. He owed money to his publisher and the man who helped to sell his writings. In his stories he says repeatedly that no one can have everything. He seemed to try, though. It looked for a brief time like he might succeed.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSTEVE EMBER: Fitzgerald continued to be affected by the problems that would finally kill him -- the drinking and the debts. Yet by nineteen twenty-five his best novel, &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; was published.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt is the story of a young man\'s search for his idea of love. It also is a story of what the young man must do to win that love before he discovers that it is not worth having.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nNext week we shall discuss this important novel. And we shall tell you about the rest of Fitzgerald\'s short life.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSHIRLEY GRIFFITH: This PEOPLE IN AMERICA program was written by Richard Thorman and produced by Lawan Davis.

It was the time of the big Depression. The song had meaning for many people who had lost their jobs.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nA <span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><strong>dime</strong></span> is a piece of money whose value is one-tenth of a dollar. Today, a dime does not buy much. But it was different in the nineteen thirties. A dime sometimes meant the difference between eating and starving.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe American economy today is much better. Yet, many workers are concerned about losing their jobs as companies re-organize.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAmericans have special ways of talking about economic troubles. People in businesses may say they feel the pinch. Or they may say they are up against it. Or, if things are really bad, they may say they have to <span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><strong>throw in the towel</strong></span>.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nA <span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><strong>pinch</strong></span> is painful pressure. To feel the pinch is to suffer painful pressure involving money.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe expression, feel the pinch, has been used since the sixteenth century. The famous English writer William Shakespeare wrote something very close to this in his great play &quot;King Lear.&quot;</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nKing Lear says he would accept necessity\'s sharp pinch. He means he would have to do without many of the things he always had.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMuch later, the Times of London newspaper used the expression about bad economic times during the eighteen sixties. It said, &quot;so much money having been spent ... All classes felt the pinch.&quot;</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWorse than feeling the pinch is being up against it. The saying means to be in a lot of trouble.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWord expert James Rogers says the word &quot;it&quot; in the saying can mean any and all difficulties. He says the saying became popular in the United States and Canada in the late nineteenth century. Writer George Ade used it in a book called &quot;Artie.&quot; He wrote, &quot;I saw I was up against it.&quot;</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSometimes a business that is up against it will have to throw in the towel. This means to accept defeat or surrender.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThrowing in the towel may mean that a company will have to declare bankruptcy. The company will have to take legal steps to let people know it has no money to pay its debts.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWord expert Charles Funk says an eighteen seventy-four publication called the Slang Dictionary explains throwing in the towel. It says the words probably came from the sport of boxing, or prizefighting. The book says the saying began because a competitor\'s face was cleaned with a cloth towel or other material. When a boxer\'s towel was thrown, it meant he was admitting defeat.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMost businesses do not throw in the towel. They just re-organize so they can compete better.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThis WORDS AND THEIR STORIES was written by Jeri Watson.

Voters had a clear choice between the two candidates.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nCox supported the ideas of President Wilson. He believed the United States should take an active part in world affairs. Harding opposed the idea of internationalism. He believed the United States should worry only about events within its own borders.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWarren Harding won the election. By their votes, Americans made clear they were tired of sacrificing lives and money to solve other people\'s problems. They just wanted to live their own lives and make their own country a better place.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMAURICE JOYCE: This was a great change in the nation\'s thinking. For twenty years, since the beginning of the century, the United States had become more involved in international events.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nYoung Americans had grown up with presidents like Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt. Both Wilson and Roosevelt had active foreign policies. Both helped start the nation on the road to becoming a major world power.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThen came World War One. It was like a sharp needle that bursts a balloon. The United States and the Allies won the war against Germany and the Central Powers. But thousands of American troops had died in the European conflict. And many months were taken up by the bitter debate over the peace treaty and the League of Nations.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMost Americans did not want to hear about Europe and international peace organizations any more.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nKAY GALLANT: Instead, Americans became more concerned with material things. During World War One, they had lived under many kinds of restrictions. The federal government had controlled railroads, shipping, and industrial production. At the end of the war, these controls were lifted. Industries that had been making war supplies began making products for a peacetime economy.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWages for most workers in the United States were higher than ever at the beginning of the nineteen twenties. Men and women had enough money to enjoy life more than they had in the past.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMAURICE JOYCE: Technology made it possible for millions of people to improve their lives. It also caused great changes in American society. Two of the most important new technologies were automobiles and radio.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn the early years of the twentieth century, automobiles were very costly. Each one was built separately by a small team of skilled workers. Most Americans did not have the money to own an automobile.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThen Henry Ford decided to make cars everyone could buy. He built them on an assembly line. Cars were put together, or assembled, as they moved slowly through the factory. Each worker did just one thing to the car before it moved on to the next worker. In this way, the Ford Motor Company could build cars more quickly and easily. And it could sell them for much less money.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nloc.gov</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nCranking a Model &quot;T&quot; Ford</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nKAY GALLANT: Before long, there were cars everywhere. All these cars created a need for better roads. Outside cities, most roads were made just of dirt. They were chokingly dusty in?dry weather and impassably muddy in the rain.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThey were rough and full of holes. Few bridges connected roads across rivers and streams. America\'s new drivers demanded that these problems be fixed. So, local and state governments began building and improving roads as they had never done before.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAs new roads were built, many new businesses opened along them. There were gasoline stations and auto repair shops, of course. But soon there were eating places and hotels where travelers could eat and sleep. In the nineteen-twenties, the United States was becoming a nation of car-lovers.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMAURICE JOYCE: Cars changed more than the way Americans traveled. They changed the way Americans lived. They removed some of the limitations of living conditions.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFor example, families with cars no longer had to live in noisy, crowded cities. They could live in suburbs -- the wide-open areas outside cities. They could use their car to drive to work in the city.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBusinesses moved, too. No longer did they have to be close to railroad lines. With new cars and trucks, they could transport their goods where they wanted, when they wanted. They were no longer limited by train times.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nCars also made life on farms less lonely. It became much easier for farm families to go to town on business or to visit friends.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nKAY GALLANT: Cars helped Americans learn more about their nation. In the nineteen twenties, people could drive all across the land for not much money. Places that used to be days apart now seemed suddenly closer.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFamilies that normally stayed home on weekends and holidays began to explore the country. They drove to the seashores and lakeshores. To the mountains and forests. To places of historical importance or natural beauty.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMAURICE JOYCE: Not all the changes linked to the car were good, of course.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAutomobile accidents became more common and deadly. Other forms of transportation, such as railroads, began to suffer from the competition. Some railroads had to close down. Horses and wagons -- once the most common form of transportation -- began to disappear from city streets.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThere were not enough cars in the nineteen-twenties to cause severe air pollution. But the air was becoming less pure every year. And the roads were becoming more crowded and noisy.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nKAY GALLANT: While the automobile greatly changed America\'s transportation, radio greatly changed its communication.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe first radio station opened in the state of Pennsylvania in nineteen-twenty. Within ten years, there were hundreds of others. There were more than thirteen million radio receivers. Most of the radio stations were owned by large broadcasting networks. These networks were able to broadcast the same program to stations all over the country.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMAURICE JOYCE: Most programs were simple and entertaining. There were radio plays, comedy shows, and music programs. But there also were news reports and political events. Millions of people who never read newspapers now heard the news on radio. Citizens everywhere could hear the president\'s voice.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nLike the automobile, radio helped bring Americans together. They were able to share many of the same events and experiences.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nKAY GALLANT: Radio also was a great help to companies. Businesses could buy time on radio programs for advertisements. In these \'ads\', they told listeners about their products. They urged them to buy the products: cars. Electric refrigerators. Foods. Medicines. In this way, companies quickly and easily created a nationwide demand for their goods.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAutomobiles and radios were not the only new technologies to change American life in the days after World War One. Still one more invention would have a great effect on how Americans spent their time and money. That was the motion picture.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt will be our story next week.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n(MUSIC)</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMARIO RITTER: Our program was written by Frank Beardsley.

That was the impression at New York\'s Rockefeller Center on Friday as workers carefully put in place and secured a 22 meter tall Norway Spruce tree that, when illuminated, will serve as one of the Big Apple\'s most recognizable and beloved holiday icons.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAmid a press of tourists, curious passersby and TV crews from nearly a dozen media outlets, a somewhere tired looking construction worker gazed up at a giant crane that has just put this year\'s Rockefeller Center Christmas tree more or less upright.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe wiped the sweat from his brow, and gave a status report on the tree, which is as yet unadorned with the 30,000 glittering lights and giant crystal star that will illuminate it on November 30. &quot;It will be stood up and secured with four cables today, All the scaffolding will go up. Monday we\'ll start decorating and putting the lights on, getting ready for the lighting,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSoon rather than later is just fine with Steve, a native New Yorker who stood nearby looking up at the tree and grinning.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;I think it smart to put it up early so it\'s up and decorated and beautiful for the holidays... It wouldn\'t be Christmas without seeing the tree in the middle of Rockefeller Center. So it\'s a be rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; rev=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;http://www.voanews.com/includes/pri\'s gorgeous. It\'s part of New York\'s culture,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBut the tree isn\'t just for New Yorkers. For Rick and Jessica, two twenty-somethings from Bloomington Indiana, it will be a highlight of a whirlwind tour of New York that will also include Times Square, the Empire State Building, and two Broadways shows.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;Of course, it\'s Rockefeller Center so we had to come by. And we happen to be here when the tree is coming up so that\'s pretty cool. Its\' one of those things you hear about. You see it on the TV, you see it on the news, whenever anyone is trying to make the Christmas spirit, they are probably going to reference or show the tree. It\'s about the most iconic thing you can get, yeah! Actually, a good friend of mine who went to Fordham came with his wife last year, and they did the walk around here and he proposed in this area right around the tree. So it\'s very much iconic,&quot; said Rick.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFor Carol and Noel from Palm Springs, California, it was neither luck, nor the sheer size of the tree that got them to this spot. &quot;We smelled the pine needles. It was beautiful,&quot; said Noel.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;We picked the perfect time to come. We didn\'t even think it would be here yet. And I hope after decorating it kinds of brings down the branches. It looks like it kind of warped for a while in wrappings,&quot; added Carol.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFor Peter Acton, a firefighter and his family, this day is an emotional one. The tree grew and was felled on their land in rural New York State. &quot;The tree was from our house. It was growing there for over 70 years. It was part of our house. We\'ve picnicked under it. We\'ve enjoyed it so much, and now New York and the rest of the world will get to enjoy it as much as we have hopefully,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFor both Peter and his 11-year-old son Seamus, the fact that agents of Rockefeller Center found the tree on September 11th 2010 is also highly significant.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;It\'s tough to talk about but it\'s a little glimmer of hope in the healing process to bring my family a little bit closer and hopefully bring my family and the whole world a little closer too,&quot; said Peter.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;And it\'s like a gift from us to the city. I just feel relieved that it\'s over with and no more people have to come to our house because they make a mess so... I just want to get back to being a regular person,&quot; added Seamus.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nA comment true both to the joyful spirit of the upcoming Christmas season, and what for many will be its inevitable exhausted aftermath.</p>','http://www.tingclass.com/plus/down.php?aid=208547');

Each year, the U.S.-based Committee honors journalists who risk their lives to do their jobs.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThis year, four journalists will receive the International Press Freedom Award at a ceremony in New York next week.

In my case, my work is humor and humor has always been society\'s voice,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe Venezuelan government wants to prosecute Marquez. He says the government\'s reaction to his writing shows how freedom of expression in Venezuela is deteriorating. &quot;Media outlets that have been critical of the government have been shut down and also some media outlets are practicing self censorship. Protest is being criminalized so that people are afraid to criticize the government,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nNadira Isayeva of Russia also faces prosecution. She is editor-in-chief of a weekly newspaper in the southern republic of Dagestan and has written about how Russian security forces combat Islamic militants. After publishing an interview with a former guerrilla leader who accused authorities of corruption, the government accused her of being an extremist. She faces the possibility of eight years in prison, but says she feels vindicated by the Press Freedom Award.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;I broke into tears because there was a lot of misunderstanding about my personal position and of the position of the newspaper in general,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nEthiopian authorities jailed Dawit Kebede for nearly two years for his reporting on the country\'s 2005 election violence. He remained in Ethiopia, even though many of his colleagues left the country.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;I always wanted to be a journalist. It was the only thing in my mind,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nKebede says the government\'s response to his work encourages him to continue. &quot;As far as the government trying to undermine you, by different harassment, that\'s a recognition that you\'re doing your professional duty,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIranian journalist Mohammad Davari is serving a five-year prison sentence and cannot personally accept his award. Iranian authorities arrested him last year on charges of &quot;mutiny against the regime,&quot; following his investigative report on the abusive treatment of prisoners.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nJoel Simon is the executive director of Committee to Protect Journalists. &quot;Davari is paying a terrible personal price for doing what journalists are supposed to do, exposing corruption and abuse,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe other three award winners face the same threat of prison, but they say that will not stop them from reporting the truth.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>','http://www.tingclass.com/plus/down.php?aid=208924');

So, nothing of this is very favorable, but it adds to the death toll.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Aid agencies say their efforts to control the cholera epidemic are being seriously hampered by riots.

Instead of taking a pill or getting a shot, patients would inhale their medicine to get the drug deep into the lungs.</p>\r\n<p>Tuberculosis is one of the world\'s most serious health challenges. The World Health Organization says one-third of the world\'s population is infected - that\'s two billion people. The vast majority of them never get sick, but last year alone more than nine million did, and an estimated 1.7 million died from TB.</p>\r\n<p>Treating tuberculosis has never been easy. Drugs must be taken for months, and too often patients stop taking the pills, which opens the way for resistant forms of the disease to develop. So the search is on for better ways to treat TB.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nA PhD student at the University of Colorado has been exploring using existing drugs in a new form - a very fine powder that is inhaled, instead of a pill. J\'aime Manion says most tuberculosis bacteria cluster in the lungs, so delivering drugs directly to the lungs can be more effective, faster, and require lower doses.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Over and over again we see that when you treat with inhalation, you see a faster clearance of the bacteria,&quot; she said. &quot;And this is so important because the treatment times for tuberculosis are from three to six months, with tons of antibiotics, with terrible side effects.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Manion has been working with inhalable particles that are about three microns in diameter - three one-thousandths of a millimeter across.</p>\r\n<p>Creating the inhalant from an established drug that\'s manufactured in pill form isn\'t simply a matter of grinding it up into a fine powder. Manion says she and her team found that adding an amino acid called leucine gave the powdered medicine some useful properties, such as keeping the individual particles from sticking together.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;And when they\'re less sticky, they\'re able to blow apart and disperse better. And that\'s a really big, important thing for inhalable antibiotics because we want them to not go in as a clump, but to go in as individual particles and to make the most of their small size, so that they get where they\'re going and they get to the deepest, smallest parts of the lungs,&quot; Manion explained.</p>\r\n<p>By inhaling the drug, the patient gets the medicine directly into the lungs, where most of the target tuberculosis bacteria are.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;The point of the inhalable antibiotics is, we can concentrate a dose in this area, and then maybe get more effect out of a lower dose because it\'s concentrated into a smaller area and it\'s hitting the affected site,&quot; she said. &quot;And after it hits its target, it then is absorbed by the bloodstream and does further good in the body.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Inhaled drugs are already being used to treat other diseases, including asthma and cystic fibrosis. The challenges have mainly been in manufacturing the drug in such a way that the ultra-small particles actually get into the tiny passageways deep in the lungs. But scientists are overcoming some of those challenges.</p>\r\n<p>At the same joint meeting of the International Pharmaceutical Federation and the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists where J\'aime Manion presented her research, others were sharing their findings on inhalable drug delivery for conditions ranging from human papillomavirus to lung cancer.</p>\r\n<p>Manion\'s work so far has focused on developing an inhalable form of tuberculosis antibiotics. Now that she has, she hopes other researchers will be able to continue the process with tests on laboratory animals.</p>','http://s5.hxen.com/m2/standard/2010/11/20101120c.mp3');

The TSA is feeling major <span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><strong>pushback</strong></span> on full body scans and <span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><strong>pat-downs</strong></span>.

No. I mean, who would?</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt\'s a question a lot of people are asking when they see videos like this. It\'s gone viral online.

Meanwhile, TSA chief John Pistole now finds himself answering to critics who say something has to give.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWell,We\'re always looking at ways that we can evolve our technology and protocols for how we go about and do this. In the short term, there will not be any changes.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe TSA points out that millions of Americans fly every day and that the number of complaints is extremely low.

and a few helpings of food and football, too.&nbsp; And just as folks have done in every Thanksgiving since the first, we&rsquo;ll spend some time taking stock of what we&rsquo;re thankful for: the God-given bounty of America, and the blessings of one another.</p>\r\n<p>This is also a holiday that captures that distinctly American impulse to give something of ourselves.&nbsp; Even as we speak, there are countless Americans serving at soup kitchens and food pantries; contributing to their communities; and standing guard around the world.</p>\r\n<p>And in a larger sense, that&rsquo;s emblematic of what Americans have always done.&nbsp; We come together and do what&rsquo;s required to make tomorrow better than today.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s who we are.</p>\r\n<p>Consider our journey since that first Thanksgiving.&nbsp; We are among the world&rsquo;s youngest of peoples, but time and again, we have boldly and resiliently led the way forward.&nbsp; Against tough odds, we are a people who endure &ndash; who explored and settled a vast and untamed continent; who built a powerful economy and stood against tyranny in all its forms; who marched and fought for equality, and connected a globe with our own science and imagination.</p>\r\n<p>None of that progress was predestined.&nbsp; None of it came easily.&nbsp; Instead, the blessings for which we give thanks today are the product of choices made by our parents, and grandparents, and generations before &ndash; whose determination and sacrifice ensured a better future for us.</p>\r\n<p>This holiday season, we must resolve once more to do the same.</p>\r\n<p>This is not the hardest Thanksgiving America has ever faced.&nbsp; But as long as many members of our American family are hurting, we&rsquo;ve got to look out for one another.&nbsp; As long as many of our sons and daughters and husbands and wives are at war, we&rsquo;ve got to support their mission and honor their service.&nbsp; And as long as many of our friends and neighbors are looking for work, we&rsquo;ve got to do everything we can to accelerate this recovery and keep our economy moving forward.</p>\r\n<p>And we will.&nbsp; But we won&rsquo;t do it as any one political party.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got to do it as one people.&nbsp; And in the coming weeks and months, I hope that we can work together, Democrats and Republicans and Independents alike, to make progress on these and other issues.</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s why, next week, I&rsquo;ve invited the leadership of both parties to the White House for a real and honest discussion &ndash; because I believe that if we stop talking at one another, and start talking with one another, we can get a lot done.</p>\r\n<p>For what we are called to do again today isn&rsquo;t about Democrats or Republicans.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not about left or right.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about us.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about what we know this country is capable of.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about what we want America to be in this new century.</p>\r\n<p>A vibrant nation that makes sure its children are the best-educated in the world.&nbsp; A healthy, growing economy that runs on clean energy and creates the jobs of tomorrow.&nbsp; A responsible government that reduces its deficits.&nbsp; An America where every citizen is able to go as far as he or she desires.</p>\r\n<p>We can do all this, because we&rsquo;ve done it before.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re made of the same sturdy stuff as the travelers who sat down to the first Thanksgiving, and all who came after &ndash; who worked, and sacrificed, and invested, because they believed that their efforts would make the difference for us.</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s who we are.&nbsp; We shape our own destiny with conviction, compassion, and clear and common purpose.&nbsp; We honor our past and press forward with the knowledge that tomorrow will be better than today.&nbsp; We are Americans.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the vision we won&rsquo;t lose sight of.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the legacy that falls to our generation.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the challenge that together, we are going to meet.</p>\r\n<p>To every American, I am thankful for the privilege of being your President.&nbsp;

The US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said that most soldiers surveyed supported this view. From Washington, Paul Adams.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRobert Gates said that a strong majority of service personnel favoured repealing the law. If implemented carefully, he said, the consequences should be minimal. The key to success would be training, education and strong leadership. Mr Gates urged Congress to repeal the 1993 law by the end of the year. The defence secretary did acknowledge that in certain all male combat units, notably among Special Forces and the Marine Corps, there are serious reservations about repeal. But he said there was a real danger that the courts which had already attempted to intervene, would try again to overturn the law. This, he said, would be the most hazardous way to do it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the latest batch of documents released by Wikileaks, the US, Britain and Russia have all expressed strong concern that Islamist militants could steal enough nuclear material from Pakistan facilities to build a crude nuclear device. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner has more details.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA US diplomatic cable said last year the UK had deep concerns about the safety and security of Pakistan&rsquo;s nuclear weapons that followed a meeting between US diplomats and Mariot Leslie, then the director of defence and strategic threats of the foreign office. Another US cable sent back to Washington last year but the US ambassador in Islamabad confided on major concern he&rsquo;s not having the Islamic militants steal an entire weapon and rather the chance someone working in government of Pakistan facilities could gradually smuggle enough material out to eventually make a weapon. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLeaked American diplomatic messages indicate that Britain promised to protect US interests during an inquiry set up last year to investigate the causes of the war in Iraq. A document released on the Wikileaks website says the assurances were given during a meeting between British defence officials and a visiting American delegation. The British said that measures had been put in place to protect US interests. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a continued size of concern in the financial markets over the European debt despite the bailout package agreed for Ireland last week, there were worries that Spain and Portugal may need outside help to repay their debts. Here is Andrew Walker.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s very clear that the financial rescue agreed on Sunday for Ireland has not resolved the worries in the markets about government debt in the euro area. Portugal and then Spain are seen as the next countries that might struggle to repay their debts and need financial help. The further falling in the euro reflects that concern and so did the fact that the interest rates on their debts have risen again. The rates for Italy and Belgium are substantially lower, but there&rsquo;d also a reason as their finances begin to receive more attention in the markets. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorld News from the BBC<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe electoral commission in Ivory Coast has delayed announcing results from Sunday&rsquo;s presidential election as each side in the run-off continues to accuse the other of cheating. A BBC correspondent in the commercial capital Abidjan says the situation is becoming increasingly tense and there was a heavy security presence on the streets. Supporters of the opposition candidate, Alassane Ouattara, have accused President Laurent Gbagbo of trying to confiscate power. Mr Gbagbo says he reserves the right to annul results from Mr Ouattara&rsquo;s stronghold in the north of the country due to allege fraud. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe opposition in Egypt has reacted angrily to the outcome of Sunday&rsquo;s parliamentary election. The official results have yet to be announced and some seats will be decided in a run-off this weekend. But state media said President Mubarak&rsquo;s ruling party had won a landslide victory. The main Egyptian opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood, said the vote was illegal. From Cairo, Jon Leyne.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe outrage has come from a coasty opposition. The Muslim Brotherhood complained that the election was rigged. They said they were undecided whether or not to boycott the run-off election on Sunday which would be their only chance of winning any seats. But the protests have been equally strong from the second opposition parties. The main&nbsp;<font face=\"Georgia\">one al-Wafd&nbsp;</font> are widely believed to have a close relationship with the government and were expected to replace the Brotherhood as the main opposition.

The North shelled a South Korean island last week, and the head of South Korea&rsquo;s spy agency has warned that further attacks are highly likely. He told the parliament that the shelling was linked to attempts to install Kim Jong-il&rsquo;s third son as the North&rsquo;s next leader.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCuba has launched a public debate on plans to transform its struggling socialist economy by reducing the role of state and boosting private enterprise. Originally, Cubans are being encouraged to discuss the changes in meetings so that their views can be taken into account at a congress of the ruling communist party next April. It&rsquo;s not clear how much influence there will have, as the details of the economic changes have not been announced and the government insists the socialist nature of Cuba is irrevocable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Sri Lankan government is turning a vast area of jungle that was the base of the Tamil Tiger rebel movement into a wildlife sanctuary. It says the former warzone in the north would be used to help wild elephants. The area was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting during the final stages of Sri Lanka&rsquo;s bloody civil war 18 months ago.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA new study suggests that there could be three times more stars in the universe than previously thought. According to the astronomers, this means that there are probably many more planets as well, which they say makes it more likely that there&rsquo;s life elsewhere. Here&rsquo;s our science correspondent Pallab Ghosh.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAstronomers have assumed that the composition of all galaxies is the same as our own. But using new, more powerful instruments, researchers have discovered that older galaxies contain 20 times more small dim stars called Red Dwarfs than younger galaxies such as our own. The discovery also increases the estimate of the number of planets in the universe and therefore makes it even more likely that there&rsquo;s life somewhere else in the cosmos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBBC News.</p>','http://enedu.putclub.com/update/sest/201012/02/putclub.com_20101202BBC.mp3');

Alex Capstick reports.</font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">Fifa has chosen new frontiers for its flagship event. It will go to Eastern Europe for the first time. In the end, Vladimir Putin\'s no-show didn\'t matter. Russia\'s plea to stage the World Cup in the world\'s largest country has worked. It was an ambitious and expensive bid, billions of dollars will be needed to build new stadiums and improve the nation\'s infrastructure. The choice of Qatar was a much bigger surprise. The bid team asked for Fifa to take a bold gamble, but promised there would be no risk. The message clearly got through.</font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">The Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said modern stadiums would be built on time and to perfection. He was speaking usually in English in Zurich arriving only after Fifa had announced its verdict. In Qatar, there were scenes of jubilation with thousands dancing along Doha\'s waterfront.</font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">The military in Ivory Coast has announced the closure of all of the country\'s land, sea and air borders following the announcement that the opposition candidate Alassane Ouattara won last Sunday\'s presidential election run-off. The chairman of Ivory Coast\'s election commission, Youssouf Bakayoko, said Mr Ouattara had won 54% of the vote against 46% for the incumbent Laurent Gbagbo. However, the head of the constitutional council, who\'s a close ally of Mr Gbagbo, said the commission\'s announcement had been invalid. An election result can not become legally binding until the constitutional council approves it. </font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">A huge wildfire in northern Israel has killed about 40 people and injured dozens of others. One report said burning rubbish may have caused the blaze. Jon Donnison reports from Jerusalem.</font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">Firefighters here say Israel has not seen a blaze like this in more than a decade. It\'s burning in the Carmel hills close to the northern Israeli city of Haifa. It\'s believed many of those who died were prison officers trying to evacuate inmates from a nearby jail. There were travelling by a bus when it got caught up in the fire. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called it an unprecedented disaster in Israel.</font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">The United States\' top military officer, Admiral Mike Mullen, says American troops are ready for the repeal of a ban on gays serving openly in the armed forces. He was speaking at a congressional hearing with the Defence Secretary Robert Gates. But as Paul Adams reports, Republicans want to keep the ban in place. </font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">John McCain, a former navy pilot, is leading Republican opposition to repeal of the law known as &quot;don\'t ask, don\'t tell&quot;. Grilling Secretary Gates during a Senate hearing, Mr McCain warned against what he called a rush to repeal. But the chairman of the Senate committee, Democrat Carl Levin, said it was time to honour the service and sacrifice of gay personnel. The country\'s top military commander, Admiral Mike Mullen, said repeal would actually improve the military and he said he couldn\'t think of a better time to do it. </font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">BBC News </font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">A British company says it\'s discovered oil off the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, the second such find this year. The firm, Desire Petroleum, said it would carry out further tests to assess the significance of the discovery. It said it believed further oil fields would be found in the area. Oil exploration around the Falklands has angered Argentina which challenges British sovereignty over the islands it calls the Malvinas. </font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">Freezing weather has continued to cause travel chaos across northern Europe. Heave snow severely disrupted train services in Britain, France and Germany. Thousands of rail passengers in Germany slept in stranded trains. Britain\'s second busiest airport, Gatwick, was closed for a second day and flights were delayed in Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and Geneva. Flooding in Albania, Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia has forced thousands of people out of their homes.</font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">Greek students demonstrating against education reforms have clashed with police in Athens. Police fired tear gas as more than 1,000 protesters tried to march on the British embassy. The demonstrators had wanted to express solidarity with British students who face a rise in the cost of paying for their tuition. The Greek government is making changes to education as part of its continuing austerity drive. </font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">Scientists have discovered a new bacterium that replaces its phosphorus with normally poisonous arsenic. The discovery could expand the search for life on Earth and beyond. With the details, here is Jason Palmer.</font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">Life, the rule goes, comprises at least six chemical elements, one of which is phosphorus. But scientists have found a bacterium in a salty lake that seems to content to replace phosphorus with normally poisonous arsenic. Hardy bacteria that eat arsenic have been found before. But this creature build to the element into its very machinery even its DNA. The find supports the idea long held by astrobiologists that if we look for life elsewhere in the cosmos we might find chemistry that is nothing like our own. </font></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><font color=\"#000000\">BBC News</font></font></span></span></p>\r\n<div id=\"post_rate_div_2442479\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','http://enedu.putclub.com/update/sest/201012/03/putclub.com_20101203BBC.mp3');

Now make yourself a cup of hot tea, sit back, and I\'ll tell you a story about Bressanone... <br />\r\nSeveral years ago, I fell deeply in love with a young woman, and also with a part of northern Italy known as South Tyrol. It borders Austria, just south of the Brenner mountain pass which separates Italy from Austria. <br />\r\nSouth Tyrol used to be joined with North Tyrol (now a part of Austria) and West Tyrol (now a part of Switzerland). The people of this area speak a dialect of German. But since Tyrol was divided and South Tyrol became a part of Italy, all the place names are in both German and Italian. <br />\r\nAnyway... I once worked for Greenpeace many years ago, where I met a young woman who melted my heart. We met while on a retreat in California\'s Yosemite National Park. After the retreat, she returned to the Colorado Greenpeace office, and eventually went back to school in New York state. I returned to the San Diego Greenpeace Office, and eventually went back to my home in the Yukon, Canada. <br />\r\nOver the months we stayed in touch. Soon we discovered that we would both be close again. She was going to study art in Florence, Italy, and I was going to live in Munich, Germany performing with a rock band called &quot;Marching Powder&quot;... ahhhh yes, Marching Powder... but that\'s another story. <br />\r\nWhen we were both in Europe, we made arrangements to meet in a place that was close to being between Florence and Munich. This was the South Tyrolian town called &quot;Brixen&quot; in German, or &quot;Bressanone&quot; in Italian. Bressanone is a beautiful town surrounded by small villages high in the mountain valleys with churches ringing and sheep in the meadows, and the awesome peaks of the Dolomite mountains towering beyond. <br />\r\nWe spent several days exploring the mountain villages and each other\'s hearts. And when the day came for her to return, I took her to a train station in a nearby village, and we said goodbye. It was very sad to be going our own ways again. With tears in my eyes, I got on a bus and headed for the train station in Bressanone. During the short 40 minute bus ride, I fell asleep. And while I slept, I had a dream in which I could hear this song, complete with the words and music. When I awoke, I got off the train and went to the nearest coffee shop to write the words and music on a napkin, so I would not forget. #p#分页标题#e#<br />\r\nIt was years later when I finally recorded the song. I will always have a place in my heart for her... and for that village... and for this song. <br />\r\nThank you for listening. Now... off to bed with you!!! <br />\r\n:-) <br />\r\nMatthew <br />\r\n2、歌词<br />\r\nHere I stand in Bressanone with the stars up in the sky<br />\r\nAre they shining over Brenner<br />\r\nand upon the other side you would be a sweet surrender<br />\r\nI must go the other way<br />\r\nAnd my train will carry me onward though my heart would surdly stay<br />\r\nWo my heart would surely stay<br />\r\nMow the clouds are flying by me<br />\r\nand the moon is the rise I have left stars behind me<br />\r\nthey were disamondsin your skies<br />\r\nYou would be a sweet surrender<br />\r\nI must go the other way<br />\r\nAnd my train will carry me onward though my heart would surely stay<br />\r\nWo my heart would surely stay<br />\r\n我站在布列瑟侬的星空下<br />\r\n而星星，也在天的另一边照着布列勒。<br />\r\n请你温柔的放手，因我必须远走。<br />\r\n虽然，火车将带走我的人，但我的心，却不会片刻相离。<br />\r\n哦，我的心不会片刻相离。<br />\r\n看着身边白云浮掠，日落月升。<br />\r\n我将星辰抛在身后，让他们点亮你的天空 。 <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>','http://www.shenzhenconcerthall.com/Upload/9/multimedia/2009multimedia/Bressanone.mp3');
